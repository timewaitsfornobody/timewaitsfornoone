To achieve their potential, mining technologies need to be theoretically focused. We present data theory as a crucial component of text mining, and provide a substantive proto- theory from the synthesis of complex multigames, prototype concepts, and emotio-cognitive orientation fields. We discuss how the data theory presented informs the application of text mining to mining discourse(s) and how, in turn, this allows for modeling across contextual thresholds. Finally, the relationship between discourse mining, data theory, and thresholds is illustrated with an historical example, the events surrounding the 1992 civil war in Tajikistan.", "authors": [{"name": "David L.

During Q-learning, an agent makes action selections in an effort to maximize a reward signal obtained from the environment. Based on reward, agent will make changes in its policy for future actions. The problem considered in this paper is the overestimation of expected value of cumulative future discounted rewards. This discounted reward is used in evaluating agent actions and policy during reinforcement learning. Due to the overestimation of discounted reward action evaluation and policy changes are not accurate. The solution to this problem results from a form Q-learning algorithm using a combination of approximation spaces and Q-learning to estimate the expected value of returns on actions. This is made possible by considering behavior patterns of an agent in scope of approximation spaces. The framework provided by an approximation space makes it possible to measure the degree that agent behaviors are a part of (''covered by'') a set of accepted agent behaviors that serve as a behavior evaluation norm.", "authors": [{"name": "Deepshikha  Pandey", "ids": ["2986347"]}, {"name": "Punit  Pandey", "ids": ["3002436"]}], "inCitations": ["62209006b825c39b787790bd85c07b0dd60b478d", "1eacbeaa9c7abaa13510ce50a5f2e4e9da9e9c09", "e8c4536da5bbdb4da645da5288d41b2f3b5338b7", "eeb65aace67c6a56f15196f28a1cd33bfb23ef44", "05f65c27b70a4f0312c7334918db93c5651d5793", "612202fd309100fe459914cc6bd876dbc0c24223", "d97a22ca26fec6c514c69b997b2ac82062c1bddc", "327b0c1b53e8a71ad361ce3a9e491554ae181ceb", "ddb11a4fd1627f3735c6136f72e12b806529c73c", "f5b34d8686ed9b9434e3e0d72f34057cdc7f0bda", "ffbfbca2e23a2489e64a58fbc8033ea004de6062", "ec4a9e3df53eb17f9d15e658eaff790a36ed9e5d", "cca6770823617d8754aaaf995585e5298565e122", "09f38b8008255f5b588889ebe3845dc457f76458", "27121dbfa3db121ceedf1d7536970e89b141991d", "f5b995644ede035da7faa1921d8057eb4f0905b4", "cc5cbf8b25b560674c54eba5ef1cd3084dc4c260", "289ae66ef9716723c9351c58aceb988d6b204ea4"], "outCitations": ["c6711e997604f5d7481fc871b06b1f0444352ec4", "12d1d070a53d4084d88a77b8b143bad51c40c38f", "c560b30c8e131782278fdee1e0d60895c09c028d", "97efafdb4a3942ab3efba53ded7413199f79c054", "26b8747eb4d7fb4d4fc45707606d5e969b9afb0c", "50a07188d718a7cf5808e16ff99cceb5a51f6659", "7708178d34d069b58a88ea4eb13aa1f57d87bedb"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3113973f3926405225e72b5fd5d9316c2c959415", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2010 Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing", "journalName": "2010 Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "317-320", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.38", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.38", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2080889016", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

The approach mainly consists of two phases. First, face images are preprocessed by the proposed illumination normalization method using Gabor wavelets. Then, upgrading the performance of Gabor kernels reduction based on the similarity of Gabor features vector, the location of facial features can fit more efficient and fast by the proposed feature-based weighted warping. The advantages of this proposed method not only obtain the better face alignment, but also overcome the active shape model (ASM) method which caused the failure for aligned target. The experimental results verify that this approach can achieve in AR face database with face occlusion cases and Yale face database_B with varied illumination conditions.", "authors": [{"name": "Hui-Yu  Huang", "ids": ["153233814"]}, {"name": "Shih-Hang  Hsu", "ids": ["2782376"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["6f3f83c0c6e6fe0f8db63299e52b837ebd4bfc2d", "2ef42ceaad948b06a8832ff89286ee4f6cf9e52d", "32df0196c3135c7732c31561b50c343551fbcfe4", "27cad662bbe099539f74d5edb434007bea66f393", "f731b6745d829241941307c3ebf163e90e200318", "2e6abc648247801164d637e99c52006289a9cd31", "2c087aa8a787033be5e175123c667e0b3e8209fd", "75f88d550c8e2e9a6033da64bd6a54d289910dfc", "b47a973fec75e399f8530da5aa51deea271e5fb2", "6d96f946aaabc734af7fe3fc4454cf8547fcd5ed", "dc6ea0e30e46163b706f2f8bdc9c67ca87f83d63", "5ca23ceb0636dfc34c114d4af7276a588e0e8dac", "c850783d06383205be21097b0dd4a0b7502b28f5", "f954137c1765a29685794eb0f901805c28e610ca", "6642e9c6cf7432e2d11b7edf7cd47f1285acd54e"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0c247ac797a5d4035469abc3f9a0a2ccba49f4d8", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016715"], "venue": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "1", "journalPages": "372-376", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016715", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016715", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "magId": "2157296872", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Most MKL methods employ the L1-norm simplex constraints on the combination weights of kernels, which therefore involves optimization of a non-smooth function of the kernel weights. These methods usually divide the optimization into two cycles: one cycle deals with the optimization on the kernel combination weights, and the other cycle updates the parameters of SVM. Despite the success of their efficiency, they tend to discard informative complementary kernels. To improve accuracy, we introduce smoothness to the optimization procedure. Furthermore, we transform the optimization into a single smooth convex optimization problem and employ the Nesterov's method to efficiently solve the optimization problem.

The experimental results show that the proposed tracking approach is more robust than the conventional mean shift tacking algorithm and the cost of increasing computation time is also moderate.", "authors": [{"name": "Ming-Yi  Ju", "ids": ["35406588"]}, {"name": "Chen-Sen  Ouyang", "ids": ["2228502"]}, {"name": "Hao-Shiu  Chang", "ids": ["3259840"]}], "inCitations": ["50048ad075da35885d4e8b7ddfd01db90d46021f", "816c6fa4f678c779a2536ce9db5c56297f6bfebc", "14039c859e84e78b7321ad29294bc53d50818b93", "b80cf3311a598b9831970b38467227928ef3b310", "428b627679863833e219b575230be834aaff1102", "5515177d75b0b70aaa1fe10d71dd6d03b4558908", "605c9bb4bb27f0ea3be720cd4f52cd03cc26699d", "e505698a713aa023618e236fac154f69aeac8459", "e16f4bb17655cc90a52c14f54400829dd3714fd4", "3dc99e3f35c2d648212531782dcf40d6f19970bf", "92e5b452888260e84354bab9f3f999065c69b7a8", "be1414c63eab5c315b69d91caf712bb2b4eee2f0", "0abe781142e89fb7673ee4775e0f2d3cd8e3313f", "b212e7ae2433ca2c701983e1e0398af632e1f9d6", "e82ca7b736b5b8deb2e4a5d616ddc69b09413739", "22182395846c0c2f3539d18ff422f751376d272b", "d827f94b27b1c8bf6bb061c7f314a544f218e374", "e27c4b8658f6858d26ccbdc7f97cac28da13245b", "2ae4bf84e57413b6098ad2e79e2393f8d4321515", "29ade23d56d38f584de6f61d5754943d119f2fbb"], "outCitations": ["98431da7222ee3fe12d277facf5ca1561c56d4f3", "1603a479f0f13e6b4ad4629384b60657a8492373", "dd4bdfc5d3944e3e9573b887635487d4c5f5330f", "437c57e740a880b14c212da7985886a0a50b6c7b", "e2f6dcd0a7f21f4e9901adc127966b16b9474290", "461efc87636ff4e48323ffcb9f8fdf79cf736fb0", "1de6a77222e8482bb85aa134e646ead7f312a46c", "1c168275c59ba382588350ee1443537f59978183", "80659cb7c44bd44f93ff27e113a8a5b25bb3234c", "5d0759f072e4a12a8e04b66e9b13d0878b165b86", "74f4ecc3e4e5b91fbb54330b285ed5214afe2001"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e149a388553a7602a761939da2d3c5553a67935b", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580780"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "6", "journalPages": "2904-2908", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580780", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580780", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "magId": "2068217198", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

In these domains, the human (\u201cdependent\u201d) is connected to multiple other humans (\u201ccontrollers\u201d) via the robot proxy for long periods of time. The dependent may want to interact with humans but also to engage the robot as a medium to the World Wide Web. In the future, medical personnel may use the robot for victim assistance and comfort while the rescue team plans and monitors extrication. Other applications include healthcare, where the robot is the link between a patient and a medical provider for intermittent,routine interactions, and hostage negotiation, where police may use a bomb squad robot to talk with and build rapport with the suspect while the SWAT team uses the robot\u2019s sensors to build and maintain situation awareness.Under funding from the National Science Foundation, we are finishing the first year of investigating verbal and nonverbal communication strategies for robots who are serving as proxies for multiple humans interact with the humans who are dependent on them. Our work posits that such a robot would occupy a novel social medium position according to the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) model [Nass,Steuer, and Tauber1994] [Reeves and Nass1996]. Given that teleoperated robots are treated socially, it is unlikely that a rescue robot would be treated as a pure medium even if playing music or videos. Likewise, the limitations of autonomy and the interactions of specialists with the dependent prevent the robot from being a true social actor. Instead, social actor and pure medium are two extremes on the agent identity spectrum, with a social medium occupying a middle position.A social medium would be perceived as a loyal, helpful \u201cgo between\u201d who is an advocate for the dependent, rather than a device for accomplishing the goals of multiple controllers(medical specialist, structural engineer, rescue operations official, etc.). To explore the social medium identity,we have built a physical prototype of a Survivor Buddy and are creating autonomous affective behaviors and a social medium toolkit to explore human-robot interaction.", "authors": [{"name": "Victoria  Groom", "ids": ["2494449"]}, {"name": "Vasant  Srinivasan", "ids": ["2340340"]}, {"name": "Clifford  Nass", "ids": ["2029850"]}, {"name": "Robin R.

Taking into account the compactness characteristics of DGA data, the fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering method is adopted to pre-select samples achieved.

Using this method, the enable channels are identical wavelength operation and the unable channels are almost suppressed completely. The enable and unable channels can be setup at will based on the requirements of different applications. However, the index modulation efficiency of the sampled FBGs is very slow. To get a high efficiency, an intelligent particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to design the phase of the target spectrum. Combing the two methods together, a high efficient multi-level phase sampled FBG that each channel is suppressed or not at will, can be obtained. We also use the particle swarms optimizations (PSO) algorithm to optimize the pure phase sampling profiles of the sampled FGB. Results showed that a much high efficiency of the FBGs can be obtained compared with that obtained from the simple Inverse Fourier transformation technology. If appropriate grating period chirp and sampled period chirp is applied to such a grating, a novel FBGs based OADM or interleavers devices with dispersion or dispersion slope compensation can be designed.", "authors": [{"name": "Jing-Qiao  Gao", "ids": ["121495321"]}, {"name": "Yu-Hong  Liu", "ids": ["47909206"]}, {"name": "Jian-Hong  Di", "ids": ["123823649"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["68b282866d9686562b9902400e3e3efc1505b624", "1aedb2adc4d7639cc8a31f775d288248fcfbb63d", "239173ca005bd44d41cb071a5ca2e1d7a3c8c246", "48e46df05aba026559c29dce6f5fe449dd62c594", "55b02f8c46031d06b39bdeb4e16e79034c1ad348", "0e097caee22d507857ddf350cf3045fd261b0692", "37b529f96431ca8431810d1f15192071f73f3332", "466a5f17da9abdee69edb320196a55d061f48c17", "e738d076aa47aad7e079778e79bb0da15f9f2852", "943cb39b646be2d679f2b811cc2141f7e3cb2267", "e5b08980766222564fb98d181fe94c933a5182b1", "eaa3b29e9e24d2d831ed41412e5bd9f7bdc3e1b8", "59e6912635279930d429f8fbd08eb9b6aafa86ca", "71acd098f2a248fbcbbb5a17f494353e0e5a8748", "b7919bcfa38aa97514187501a23c983e8eb5482b"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/15083fd3f7f6be5937944f2d3632f3843ef3c335", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "3", "journalPages": "1374-1379", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212353", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212353", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2134071887", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

The results of simulation experiments carried out over AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels indicate that the proposed scheme can effectively track channel variations to switch operation mode and transmit packet and thereby significantly increases Bluetooth data throughput.", "authors": [{"name": "Tan-Hsu  Tan", "ids": ["3172122"]}, {"name": "Yung-Fa  Huang", "ids": ["1694001"]}, {"name": "Hsien-Ming  Chiu", "ids": ["1978593"]}, {"name": "Ching-Su  Chang", "ids": ["47184069"]}], "inCitations": ["640635b9403891e638bbd0c8d078a2e64f48b25b", "446ace0e1310036a38b776fe4d2c87d8d6f60ada", "3a8d4eb558090bbe581989d6a94e2e6c3c89eebd"], "outCitations": ["00046e33968ceff5a745f81d2b7eebdb4857476f", "aabf85f4df657dd52c9d17328db415ce3c515fc0", "d3ba683977b9468f6753b830ba9d5d1ca76d94c8", "85b890d4ed9f3d92f5d953b293b2a3bdf80e0e8a", "22edd1eaa0453abfde6f24d70b0a842a4b40c9fc", "d6bfcb1d2338c0369108fdaaa13d203c9a0ff8ba", "9207a37b2c234d90eeb0bd9d27e940d37745fc02", "8da415288378fc33428caef1e02462a72f8e21a8", "6c68ba30d81e77cef4522d98652805c7c9f3b5c5", "71e659061bc42758784aacf55dc1c709b7f90315", "fa466da01d44fd135b6991757f4674a9ffd4ad8f", "92cb4491b7d7a211acbf150e1592762f56d3f00b"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d8141e89108ee323c0c6da18617a0460ea1269e8", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "5", "journalPages": "2916-2921", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212608", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212608", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2118805222", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

The elimination of different point data and the smoothing of load curve are proceeded to realize the vertical processing. Then, using the method of median data generates a smooth estimated sequence for primitive load sequence.

In this article we highlight and categorize the di erent important worksin this domain. Furthermore, we present the critical parameters which a ect the complexityof the streaming algorithms accompanied with examples. In the end, we propose a newapproach for processing XML data streams using intelligent Ordered XPath that account forthese critical parameters . 1 Introduction The extensible markup language (XML) [30], has gone from the latest buzzword to an entrenchede-Business technology in record time. XML is currently being heavily pushed by the industry andcommunity as the lingua franca for data representation and exchange on the Internet. It providesa much needed non-proprietary universal format for sharing hierarchical data among di erentsoftware systems, and does so in a user-friendly manner. It is a verbose plain-text format, makingit robust, platform-independent and legible to humans without additional tools. This popularityof XML has created several important applications like information dissemination, processingof the Scienti c data, and real time news. Query Languages like XPath [14] and XQuery [4]have been proposed for accessing the XML data, which provide a syntax for specifying whichelements and attributes are sought to retrieve speci c pieces of a document.Often, data is very large to t into limited internal memory and in many cases it needs to beprocessed in real time during a single forward sequential scan. In addition, sometimes queryresults should be output as soon as they are found, in this case streaming fashion is the bestapproach to process the XML Data. The term data streaming is used to describe data itemsthat are available for reading only once and that are provided in a xed order determined by thedata source. In the streaming model queries must be known before any data arrive, so queriescan be preprocessed by building machines for query evaluation . Figure 1 illustrates a datastream processor.Figure 1: Data Stream Processor.Due to the recursive nature of XML data, the single sequential forward scan of an XML streams,also the presence of descendant axes and the predicates in an XPath query, query evaluationprocess on XML streams raises di erent challenges compared to non-streaming environments,some of them are :\u000fDuring evaluation of XPath queries that contain predicates in streaming, we may encounterdata that can be query solutions, before we reach the required data to evaluate the pred-icates", "authors": [{"name": "Muath  Alrammal", "ids": ["2107512"]}, {"name": "Ga\u00e9tan  Hains", "ids": ["145167632"]}, {"name": "Mohamed  Zergaoui", "ids": ["2339538"]}], "inCitations": ["c3f2f679e76fa8e9294da7988e094b522a1c19be", "7c19b672eb5d20c8fec80978e2987427c84cee15", "7459b3f94adad50ec80f83c2db655da6dd2438ea", "5c27d2477702b4736bb3b114994836ad49441983", "82e0108c3d20866c0b3a561a717eb8ed5523009d"], "outCitations": ["bd9e57bceeb6828c67d5638f5526257ea3676d83", "f0e7362f1eac89fed7aa704c50fcf7364b249e3b", "a439a8940ae0a6686b23cc734c8c663eae6969e0", "dbde200ff26305e4bf2c2ecd1c3dc26fc48c00bc", "35771247eb8efb077cba13eea8bee2778eda441e", "e251b5c1511136f11715915909da8f961959f9e8", "5ca097d91fc8f755705d8c71e9892b48cbb44a99", "f9ece843c8b9ba92f567a3cb461662e168067c59", "5c27d2477702b4736bb3b114994836ad49441983", "f283d164bd37b754896e497be9eb7326a5aedaaa", "f73046a35ff51c38be98590d1f74f8b1f82c1ab5", "59ece49071a7d8822bc5d903a643d6b6a3d36fac", "4d3b50097dfc06d01645ae7a308c4685ccb7f1bf", "2a9cd3525a9ae6bdd1b1332bd75768ddecd42b8d", "e2ad92d7da5149bf1437e7c8ab2172529d85f00d", "8db48c6dee55a5d10e1c04c38bfb6780605f6cb7", "b4104d2e84520f9dbf15916acb4b9ddd82fb327d", "73ccaa305fb2c47c8df3b7aaaf0fd8e94b088df7", "0420abce5921d7e80838ab746da96c1b4bc71474", "a91d95eef3c1b23179938195a5087312e6243c05", "0d924c5840f11be27f1537ab4c1b2bd00c5319ea", "10c4aaf9ad322a0673044a63fdeeaf08905c49b1", "c4dad137b66edd5efe3a205e48f988956daca7e7", "97199415b732b2dab552533fa1f0d70b7675655e", "acdf0e8810c705ef5f0f54d7a2f1b33eb22406e1", "e203a30cc4a09179d6464ae8eca73cc7a4442b03", "a1ae685e127d7d8e7bc999c3ab92d10018f72f09", "048437549082aa0e3581a5ea52e5174f93e9439f", "8b31f2e45ff25a6951f34c0f621a9992aaee615c"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a5b90b6102636f9c96722eabf99418b65e8098c4", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Spring/2009/ss09-05-002.php", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Spring/2009/SS-09-05/SS09-05-002.pdf", "http://lacl.univ-paris12.fr/Rapports/TR/TR-LACL-2008-4.pdf", "http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gaetan_Hains/publication/221251469_Intelligent_Ordered_XPath_for_Processing_Data_Streams/links/540834360cf2c48563b8c7b9.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI Spring Symposium: Intelligent Event Processing", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "6-13", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2185403656", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

One characteristic of the problem is that since the data distributions of the two domains are different, there should be different tailor-made relational logic model for each domain. On the other hand, the relational logic models should share certain amount of similarities due to the same goal and similar nature of the data. Unlike ordinary MLN learning methods, which only consider the distribution of the labeled training examples in learning, we also consider the similarities and differences between the labeled examples from the source domain and the unlabeled examples from the target domain. One major idea of our framework is that we aim at maximizing the likelihood of the observations in the unlabeled data in the target domain, and at the same time, minimizing the difference in the model probability distributions between the source and target domains. As a result, the adapted MLN is tailored to the target domain, but it does not deviate far from the source MLN. We have conducted extensive experiments on two different text mining tasks, namely, pronoun resolution and citation matching, showing consistent improvements in the performance of our adapted model.", "authors": [{"name": "Ki  Chan", "ids": ["145901622"]}, {"name": "Tak-Lam  Wong", "ids": ["39756936"]}, {"name": "Wai  Lam", "ids": ["144594306"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["b3852f0113fcf8a3913c55ae92393ae6ccde347e", "11d10dbe0802afa19525aaa137d56f2832e38d1e", "065cbc6973aacc6f41014e48c476510ed3018e71", "eb42a490cf4f186d3383c92963817d100afd81e2", "0e2b751140567ed3fd8329cb5e5bf8e1776c58f8", "9afc2cb61a4da0aa29fa9f40889d21ff67157c7a", "c7f287b62c5f0bed8e0d44604563c57908133d59", "d17d8c2fc6c8bf8bda498f9a7e4acc12f5c017b5", "0f42ea959320c3e857039ed926151ee4e83c639b", "b672ef69f60aea81220d658963445c41e60bb0e3", "18f96ef4398bb3893706c8e42d944a7108dbcb91", "1de5c530716de032d89aa6bf0e0b618494d74bda", "950a3c89dacbc3e7ddcd43d7ff6f985697e41cdb", "e54d8b07ef659f9ee2671441c4355e414e408836", "0617dd6924df7a3491c299772b70e90507b195dc", "4f410ab5c8b12b34b38421241366ee456bbebab9"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f4ba666f1c99cdf06f3a89910dce0589b212d295", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5581072"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "1", "journalPages": "167-172", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5581072", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5581072", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2005450117", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

It finds all minimal sets of ABox axioms that should be added to a background ontology to enforce entailment of a specified set of ABox axioms. As far as we know, by now there is only one ABox abduction method in expressive DLs computing abductive solutions with certain minimality. However, the method targets an ABox abduction problem that may have infinitely many abductive solutions and may not output an abductive solution in finite time. Hence, in this paper we propose a new ABox abduction problem which has only finitely many abductive solutions and also propose a novel method to solve it.

Much work in recent years has focused on improving the efficiency of these dynamic programming algorithms by exploiting symmetries and factored or relational representations. In this work, we show that it is also possible to exploit the full expressive power of first-order quantification to achieve state, action, and observation abstraction in a dynamic programming solution to relationally specified POMDPs. Among the advantages of this approach are the ability to maintain compact value function representations, abstract over the space of potentially optimal actions, and automatically derive compact conditional policy trees that minimally partition relational observation spaces according to distinctions that have an impact on policy values. This is the first lifted relational POMDP solution that can optimally accommodate actions with a potentially infinite relational space of observation outcomes.", "authors": [{"name": "Scott  Sanner", "ids": ["1732536"]}, {"name": "Kristian  Kersting", "ids": ["1746871"]}], "inCitations": ["1392c78397aed8769e3948c4d75bf6b025a5c41b", "da1be8602c735ae4d8875d7f3495de1ad1c7de7a", "499cbb596f8c42c1f254e4d85499122b9618ba24", "77b4e111120d45e41636e4fb749ee9279f266a7b", "1c730b6d2d7e0d01465af0080effb28f09997062", "869b02ebb6e8061245ae66e8112507e7ceb3829a", "811e790864c08aebd875248770d71a2ec9e979b4", "c78b409d59caa0b85d34a63a9c1f720df6e9937b", "448dc7666ea457dc1de66b1384c06ba7f3e4650f", "181558ec38be6a5afa436ef11e89106d7b6d48eb", "dde3c2431abc4d1153e4867d001b9439488a3ffb", "c4cc101f4c83ed0377c24173875ced07c0e5e701", "bdf46dfc59a289b0be434f740a9b91a909521a39", "498e1a6073501d5c2fd95f77dcd51cf02c6b2364", "49490378ad40fadbffe1e81c8b169c83a067164c", "06e908c5319c83e6a7f675edaf6a74a05f99bf3f", "953f9da07035f71f0e3cdaad1df7cebdde9ac178", "058d51b97ccde5d143d13ca9ee2bef601737f74d", "812de51ea15a8e317561fa00d133d6548cf088a7", "6f8f974ea5d038dd51958849f819579e3a3b4ee2", "e5ce1e2222ae553c1762aa61e93bd3ee74d18acd", "fcbbb39a98455db5903da6e97e2c418592c4ec69", "579f8a1f41ac3f1040ce21a0f5a4fcf97cd88ad9", "764aa81799af54e261f6eac607a29bca48ce455b", "7608ad22a4d83caa1888da28f3756a8c0a69ae24", "ecbca239e004a606b0517ff08997515fd5299f1c", "cf2a67025d8f6b1d9666adf106158a4b82ff24b0", "b9037d81b7cb4fcf9823b7f49ee9924a7df27b21", "ef9c7f30cdbd266e94ea9e83b55cfdf0786d2b40", "15b4bf52c4954456cefacd652c01b27303b49b71", "ec89db916408d7111367e03392128a152ab3f2f7", "a9f4505222a57195f135a1cad0cb812a7ef202af", "fa72081b460f5eef1d6e804f80a188bc744d51d8", "ce2afa4c57366952d7885e3418650f1f54f92387", "f500ed7e12e764eefbf9902069b960705ef8afad", "b66cf193e7b5119cdda4c18d119f9a2c3c3efd7c", "ce808e43af42c095e3dce2dff340e8d6f65f17c2", "cdab50e37415290db5f168d7cd70f6df415ce061", "75a4681b7154661b99e2541ff1a4a03180c0cc13", "67b8f5dfe742c17970961e728e3451612c15c62e", "da3059ea0db45b39d68ae7b61c59003887208eb7", "be012b674d1cc15979ce40602da67ca2d63e8052", "88972cd80663afcd2fee5299ab88c14de8006624", "54abef3043f57beb573d2647371713140a6a0cff", "914e54c0b1d88493c1276c29b3abbb956a71c7c7", "06996e180cab25c3644387bd93fb6bad6cb76556", "2f6d60e41f6537f890c15376a5fbd4f8253a20dd", "a885c028649f0cdbb2d0a8e3156c11f69b3c1030", "9075c2ba7db572cd156366798abeea8b4e532418", "6d4dec818ae36bda7dcc9f8fa7aff24e4a68d7bb", "1663959222cacaedce05520bdab703348ebbb22e", "2ed4b913bd0acb81e1bb8bd6e10622f059031b30", "ba49171391ea534fca90d8cc98257f162276dab9", "4c6cdac5d8b9bf670436429237d936ef8d8a16c8", "53aee413567bda32f85847ef562f323c401daa66", "cefe0653c4a2b6508d694f19cde87c89b68b4a85", "56d71127105be4ae378b103d78b438147fedde56", "ae413440ab6bc73dfa11c8fce2ca771d4ced6fea", "db8e5565ca350f420a37901047035f53b2bc8951", "ac6c704c4749bb9c8138c1619567af41fa6f7adf", "2ea93a47d9c55d9a564caacba5f7944755b1863f", "8f0e4b196fb1fe855ab7a42ce96cb631cf321a82", "4c4d818fa190f8f1fc8214c0dfa96292aaac4988", "04b0a2d8f98bce01a345af0931a713330467eb84", "57c063bdc52b7c49870f62be3a9b728d6aa81b8b", "9c494c5fd9c17e3bebf6252850d7a9e4c5b71fd1"], "outCitations": ["66a302e05a154fb8a937e353c5ee75407c0b93c2", "8defd9a7a432a3be38ea70f7f8abe2762832e0d3", "8090121ad488b4af27bc59bf91b62e9c6a6f49c6", "8b1367551f2d6cca65d009a60a424c1fbfbace3b", "ba49171391ea534fca90d8cc98257f162276dab9", "9d59f87b881017e6ef0198636a77ad04b7ebea7a", "1765708a752c090fc864c64f14c36b7d34ed09a2", "561dd7bbc62c5e4931dabfe4c09a33a9c0c241b3", "c64fb71dc5651d22deea99da1bccbd40071bc843", "041fa75b033880b905ab1899007aebfe405d9ec4", "1ba37f3940bac344506d0f09ba21172b52cbb1fe", "3139b1a80229b09e8b8498f0511eba0afe7a805c", "616335863b6a03779ec8c98196c6474f2084c8f2", "0f2302d6f8a7c6194eefd74d051b23e6e9e4a1da", "9692a70d08376d9709eb7ed66472b661ba7c9cb5", "116d7798c1123cf7fad4176e98f58fd49de4f8f1", "543c15d744dd7390858f4d3ad2574ff45feebd8e", "821229da85e5de4d4b7685398828847c6d671c5b"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5a5061077fd4e0978f15290b4869887374b86a92", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1840/2165", "http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~ssanner/Papers/fo_pomdp.pdf", "http://eprints.pascal-network.org/archive/00007426/01/fo_pomdp.pdf", "http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~ssanner/Papers/aaai10_slides.pdf", "http://www-ai.cs.uni-dortmund.de/PublicPublicationFiles/sanner_kersting_2010a.pdf", "http://www-kd.iai.uni-bonn.de/pubattachments/457/sanner10aaai.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1840", "http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/~ssanner/Papers/fo_pomdp.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1140-1146", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1486596527", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}
{"id": "b0768ceedcdb70662f8a52e0ecb5e7627748cd7a", "title": "Formal Argumentation and Human Reasoning: The Case of Reinstatement", "text": "Argumentation is now a very fertile area of research in Artificial Intelligence. Yet, most approaches to reasoning with arguments in AI are based on a normative perspective, relying on intuition as to what constitutes correct reasoning, sometimes aided by purpose-built hypothetical examples. For these models to be useful in agent-human argumentation, they can benefit from an alternative, positivist perspective that takes into account the empirical reality of human reasoning. To give a flavour of the kinds of lessons that this methodology can provide, we report on a psychological study exploring simple reinstatement in argumentation semantics. Empirical results show that while reinstatement is cognitively plausible in principle, it does not yield full recovery of the argument status, a notion not captured in Dung's classical model. This result suggests some possible avenues for research relevant to making formal models of argument more useful.", "authors": [{"name": "Mohammed Iqbal Madakkatel", "ids": ["2331608"]}, {"name": "Iyad  Rahwan", "ids": ["1705156"]}, {"name": "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois  Bonnefon", "ids": ["3107309"]}, {"name": "Ruqiyabi Naz Awan", "ids": ["3147759"]}, {"name": "Sherief  Abdallah", "ids": ["144578221"]}], "inCitations": ["955c257b1f611b9f1b8fa25386a30f126346bd90", "839f55554893bae843cc72fb7706478c8c76e9a5", "44ea41e7a7acfc49b9b514258e4f131cf0e84309"], "outCitations": ["30130982f2e8bf8a05bce70cc132a8abfe5c449a", "0a3044fcf9f15234af7f4250d195236a396192b6", "d84c63649ce9eb1024474149951df9ec4fee3f29", "6b7101e3619b85c1ea59e691d709b78db5a095f3", "c622888f33caed07c7510a81d67e006809a24e6b", "34116cdb9a72bcb0895c4ed07d17d67230603d33", "4ca9ceee578a2ec608149afe13de736b20ad5911", "bb02b0d08d86e97f31a4d2850cf0992f8baad779", "38cecf60c64ccc41ef105a507d9ae843397067e3", "193a0319afa14e6a7c3ff6e5699c979bc6286e29", "2d62c94a5e54b8c92a7c8de9b82dd791b734e545", "749ed7ca7b6ad4109bbd2cd17a4f759db3afd01b", "b759234f57226c97e8faa107b0571af6c14f385d", "1121cdd3d55179d01dbfd5ba1a20ea189e0b3835", "d2becfc88af3628fcde7990da4a670c5bce3a75c", "1ce03bdf54afc8b04f9aa71f92f020877c6902fe", "e657510eacda483234559f67dc09a358f4827d12", "c9b3de95cdbf2d18ca61788b8cea37a27f6c2fd0", "e96ea8a232ebf545087d38bf4bc34b602e2f68c6", "f931bd26f1040c639b0b3b6f35da1a8355095db2", "17675db8aa41f6d5f361b8a73d151ca1f210a35a"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b0768ceedcdb70662f8a52e0ecb5e7627748cd7a", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.mit.edu/~irahwan/docs/aaai_symp2009.pdf", "http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/irahwan/docs/aaai_symp2009.pdf", "http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~prakk101/uses/madakkatel.pdf", "http://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FSS/FSS09/paper/view/873"], "venue": "AAAI Fall Symposium: The Uses of Computational Argumentation", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "46-51", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2400772543", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

These algorithms are attractive since they are statistically consistent and not subject to local optima. However, they are batch methods: they need to store their entire training data set in memory at once and operate on it as a large matrix, and so they cannot scale to extremely large data sets (either many examples or many features per example). In turn, this restriction limits their ability to learn accurate models of complex systems. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new online spectral algorithm, which uses tricks such as incremental Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and random projections to scale to much larger data sets and more complex systems than previous methods. We demonstrate the new method on an inertial measurement prediction task and a high-bandwidth video mapping task and we illustrate desirable behaviors such as \"closing the loop,\" where the latent state representation changes suddenly as the learner recognizes that it has returned to a previously known place.", "authors": [{"name": "Byron  Boots", "ids": ["3288815"]}, {"name": "Geoffrey J.

With the use of spectroscopy, support vector machine (SVM) was used as regressor. It is well known that the selection of hyper-parameters including the regularization and kernel parameters is important to the performance of least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM). In this paper, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied to select the LS-SVM hyper-parameters. Additionally, to construct the learning samples, a spectrum energy-based approach is proposed to determine the wavelength region where the observed data are used to train LS-SVM for the regression task.

The participants in the negotiation adopt different tactics to pursue results that are to their best interests. Different bargaining negotiation curves represent different concession strategies that lead to the eventual bargaining outcome. To learn to predict the opponent's negotiation strategy in order to adjust one's own bargaining tactics to come out on top is the goal of each and every bargainer. This paper proposes an intelligent negotiation strategy prediction system in the bank bargaining process through the agent's calculation of the relative concession rate and round remaining rate from each one of the opponent's offers. The evolutionary fuzzy algorithm is then applied to forecast the opponent's negotiation strategy factor and negotiation curve. The Experiments in this study use real bank loan negotiation data prove that the system can predict the actual bargaining tactics used by bank clerks.", "authors": [{"name": "Wei-Min  Lee", "ids": ["2207768"]}, {"name": "Chien-Chang  Hsu", "ids": ["1711835"]}], "inCitations": ["ba0922713343493d71faf03174d54e572b221fdd", "bad7d28e36088baa1887cf4759d5774416d5ae9a", "9a35970dc6d745cf60715117f777ae66cb3943e3", "4461c89c9a996b4226d0274871c26e994704838d", "e0c639db6d9f2d63dd8618bbc72ed4d15cc8047b", "eba0c8a2be5fed8e406f2258d50522d1fee3bdc0"], "outCitations": ["97cde13538bf256f44855dfb2e6c8f634fcce079", "3cf8c4fe6da39e079d2b8ad943cce67e31fa7c7b", "61bd648dbdbac7acf8147a62dd9323d9c08004de", "0a6d2e0deacd91a0e4a4cdaaad6fcdd99a28e28c", "ef8f2bc30f4fc19f90b9a3e37bc816a207001003", "154de429d33221d4981cd44bc4815fbb13a3cd2f", "0fc426c20862a0dc60787e4c0ffd51fbf7d8963d", "567b58d877ec7d057a810e12696d83527a5685ea", "bcca3cdcfe26d3e6638638b90c36352765050261", "ea0036bc785e474f20fd4caa47677b5f94b5c585", "efc7b53bf1ebb081acacc19059b92637c9304011", "280bfd775c7f2f557cc92d74c6cf16c4e02b9f0b"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2f343930c95359a2aa1cbf69b97731f3b8e2e79a", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580687"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "6", "journalPages": "3225-3229", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580687", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580687", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2024097627", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

It relies on a procedure that partitions a set of functions, called bucket, into smaller subsets, called mini-buckets. The method has been used with a single partitioning heuristic throughout, so the impact of the partitioning algorithm on the quality of the generated bound has never been investigated. This paper addresses this issue by presenting a framework within which partitioning strategies can be described, analyzed and compared. We derive a new class of partitioning heuristics from first-principles geared for likelihood queries, demonstrate their impact on a number of benchmarks for probabilistic reasoning and show that the results are competitive (often superior) to state-of-the-art bounding schemes.", "authors": [{"name": "Emma  Rollon", "ids": ["2492844"]}, {"name": "Rina  Dechter", "ids": ["1751239"]}], "inCitations": ["7d0892c03785312245349519a937e0513d366d47", "c5642c4102965150978bfbeff2d0f63b68ed08be", "52b2ca1c3104343ed02839489be844ba8603e856", "5f74d00d14ffc843ca1f87a7d04acb240ae70e46", "6202c40bb098cc4b26a248b701538eb0e7f82898", "b777865a2e1686ae25a0a30fad57490a4ce3c7a0", "8f8e21604027627db96ee5b6de7fab97cc60b5bf", "5c051b7bcda53fc373804197a753710ca6d63133", "b4e14b172fb305a00bb67b78f9166549f8dbd6e6", "0b766137aecb89ac49151cfc2e4704259f0e255f", "d6907db3b3c28fa19952e470521519bf9e0afb55", "d17b773fa2b0009a97b3493c76094f5872655550", "f77c7770826756610cac8d094211bc30fa000131", "bb7e793bb70724da2afb24dbd141d9d538f49dd7", "e5724c98020636809508508ec35f8bb14df9dc5e", "210b4a316737e429ed213cf7c33457d4e0f32a5d", "3b7a41a06c0660dd7461ff7f83cb37b65546a7e2", "0f52fa906bb2acd8aff6f17bd8f7f8bcd3eb5719", "57639f2ca4dbc7d49dc92463351201cf4a81d55a", "7fcf5b2e4f4e9be4ec9990528455f15efdee25d2"], "outCitations": ["23e2f84886b98cf04f483fd5f80029c518270462", "1cf23e0c4bace8f1dcd21bab54640cbcf1b71366", "5bf6f01402e1648b7d1e6c9200ede6cb1af30123", "eacf0dab360f5565c18ba8ce7e1b2d751463f452", "13fbf15dce48e9a4e00654b8d4e6f42718f75062", "2a90c0588d1bf00e349abbb00dde009b6760866a", "3b66e64f48434d1a15cdc6ee383e925299bf56c8", "6053274118e18f285b9b2c6736b4e98cde810b02", "08366d82efeaf8234ae69e67e9097ee404d7b86e", "9f45e9c9775d0a65529d1c3ffaf069d27a3c7002", "599fecdb5fec6bf5c99de76088a9a3c37af6f11e", "44bed05c75b761e1ad2a93c0be35a2acb4deb5b9", "7b62e8b56e914f114c536f1d689577935352f0d3", "8580c34ada6b40cae599a01426902faa33e802aa", "70ef29e6f0ce082bb8a47fd85b9bfb7cc0f20c93"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1db7b2e39dfb7dd1a88879d28fa8b84d234be86d", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dechter/publications/r173.pdf", "http://upcommons.upc.edu/bitstream/handle/2117/12960/Rollon.pdf;jsessionid=4667017DF11D06100DC8221FAD7BDF17?sequence=1", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1891", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1891/2176", "http://upcommons.upc.edu/e-prints/bitstream/2117/12960/1/Rollon.pdf", "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dechter/publications/r173-color.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1199-1204", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1520781524", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

The advantage in combining domain knowledge and observations is that the robot can in this way project from the past into the future, and reason from observations to more general statements to help guide how it plans to act and interact. The difficulty lies in the fact that observations are typically uncertain and logical inference for completion against a knowledge base is computationally hard.", "authors": [{"name": "Hans-Ulrich  Krieger", "ids": ["35698498"]}, {"name": "Geert-Jan M.

The state-of-the-art is dominated by hierarchical pathfinding algorithms which are fast and have small memory overheads but usually return suboptimal paths. In this paper we present a novel search strategy, specific to grids, which is fast, optimal and requires no memory overhead. Our algorithm can be described as a macro operator which identifies and selectively expands only certain nodes in a grid map which we call jump points. Intermediate nodes on a path connecting two jump points are never expanded. We prove that this approach always computes optimal solutions and then undertake a thorough empirical analysis, comparing our method with related works from the literature. We find that searching with jump points can speed up A* by an order of magnitude and more and report significant improvement over the current state of the art.", "authors": [{"name": "Daniel

For each recording under investigation, the channel pattern noise severs as a unique channel identification fingerprint. Denoising filter and statistical frames are applied to extract channel pattern noise, and 6 Legendre coefficients and 6 statistical features are extracted. SVM is used to train channel noise model to judge whether the input speech is an authentic or a playback recording. The experimental results indicate that, with the designed playback detector, the equal error rate of speaker recognition system is reduced by 30%.", "authors": [{"name": "Zhifeng  Wang", "ids": ["2090914"]}, {"name": "Gang  Wei", "ids": ["144268511"]}, {"name": "Qianhua  He", "ids": ["1743121"]}], "inCitations": ["7e41a8535e4fa2f9a88b0c59c602c2343eaf085d", "c6ef8e835911b3aa48b1c19e19c1520eae3d9e6f", "ca0880fd8a9e5e265da6daf0ac6ca7f44f76a693", "e8c51cfb1a10401bbdd8044e3eaf90d21ed6d4ad", "8fcc7d7100cb394b9f90aaa798d8bfff9848d9b2", "13a0645280692b8a719cc3f6df65081d9b0be300", "bdceab5598568f8ee76de85f6961b40f464d29b8", "a48ff91ecf9088d2b34590e579685527ea3faeb1", "47c14795bd4a6f9d04766d0c68db8f2b56a1309e", "b69f5698e903bc6c84d34d098de671712c6e41f1", "aab604bdeb581da4f510b4465b974829c9ffd920", "2ccd26016c7718384c1c96774f7afa37356c791e", "015a584f0e5d0a3e356491a17e7eeddab3742acc", "bba048272e759ba418c6bd3d93a769c4b2610efb", "b2ba604548e479be5771e527d4cd0a202ae7d9ce", "04426634083c66326df6d6045a79057a68395f0f", "856b6897fddc912be06b86fa18c8138abd6b8690", "4655478bfc0f9b728fe1faf64d3d86bb1c8947ed", "01e359493127fe2f834e66c68cc23ca52c9bb771", "0e52b36ed279cd293624b7aa9ebe7eb37a2dc887", "3bd124d00c0dab7cd3176fdb61d9793fb886b90f", "56e427872d13c56d90f9bc6a7178a88755879af7", "ea09cddb61313b92bb98ffb81235191870128535", "9e2326606b4ebd3d1cd7e91e77d178ea9ace1d4b", "7d48968de4c35f46bb292ad95b775f2f77ca6bee", "64a989daeb4a4ddfa712a663bbec55fab5f0d88a", "38e1914934df86f8f662e76089b1a03e1ec09633", "6a3c6f6325eb388a8fa2580a8f1953f6e557e078", "d3e065ebbd65f09f1105b37de8d05010a4276a66", "8d6e6037b6acacca0d4bb9595c1a6d3536f1b4ac", "0b3ed61549d3484d300149f64edd86f2ca60c4eb", "b684515673a59e4491f5e2179642e206de521c31", "90da0f6fbd8c601aeef37e2ee252323d3e7b86de", "3591ddb13aa789978d9f4ac1dd8ab95e4fe548eb", "c2bc42f6f1ae435e3fd851cdd1f422689ef2be84", "19405b345f198be892260fded4dd4fee861c4a8d", "3bbd18b916b9d0d6919e02c0dbc0ac64ba72e7c6", "4f8426cfd4711b398528ea3b9c044a057eca7945", "04a9311e29bd8728104689b2804efae0dfc718e0", "7b8e00b5de09d1c112fc47111734dbc416759358", "75be7297ea40aee2c9e78e0f9d02984c376452a1", "79444895734786e526239132f0218b2ce609e671", "4a64c372a7ccf406b2e257e2029b487174435f31", "2e61d0f2a57365a703ad647d017709c0d1193d2d", "e62ed9118d7858add92141d178a31a1150ab0175", "0b9f57b0585e875602c768ce42d87c30a667060a", "9af73bb511cb2f76a54d11993be10d73cd3935ab", "6be600d60f4d3210d20567c0ab8f3d78324ab5d4", "9c31f00716ee1652a8d42db0a5b2368718f37070", "68922b210e86b6182a761e0b5d301c93c9263c6f", "0a96be6cc9fe09023c22c7f0b43fe1fdface7317", "32d3453863fee4379dd74d127312dee401470ee9", "613967849d0546628a7c223b1ebe2d152b2db158", "b215ded764183dafbd14cd77ef9cceb1494f4533", "7d966afbefc5b6de0a4bb69d018c856a63b94c3b", "476bedb2b665e14fc48124c49db79735ab916fa6", "a097d89e703525768445d6e9d5c56cedcc58939d", "d62f09bbc7290b442c81d85a9a2960744a89ccef", "4de74a4c970a9f7492ee93e4b06a210c08d2bc08", "b00527203986a4431baea6ea4cf082ec55137da9", "fffef49c5181f8f7de374495faa1290595d22fb9", "8c3fbff00cc4f3c3b4c7a59f4615a8a6068ff7b2", "a03170e9851c0278a17dbfcb026fa873d6b01169", "28dfefd46ee1c8f6ec3d36f093c75ec5f6c53b81", "743e63ba3ec84482bf1e90edb0c3f18d0c140c69", "114f9f03c2a0b9b1cb12f17a0b6e97a63115916d", "c298f364ec1cc2e81aba3462d3a90751bc6b94ba", "f96cf7380492a408abd29112156f0c7749fd68d5", "7600da341e2fb6e76534e1f9b256b8217ebf1a26", "5869ed221f0be2350e86fa26191b687f0ed57c49", "4dcd12e3907315aa0103dcdb6f2a5fb4d365e7c0", "d1da14aad07d3a378111ef1fa4fc86743d1939e8", "a0b2bfb4843e248b4464569aaf1abaa022592ad0", "71574716fc21cf5317821d7ea981d520a39ba612", "c0f5e31b87541a09d192c716129b8155aabd8387"], "outCitations": ["73c1ba50933ad62550ee479ceb7093597199bba0", "2d0b8d027b918b323bc0bd8ecdc6b748fa64a449", "f1cc31c72e025229c4b919906e6dd77aa72a841f", "595072cb6a273aaf5427ffd723c61d53376c5aba", "76fcfe7da2690eb6f16dd0cba6621b75698f4951", "da6f104f1607791b37538d2c999ac296abd9cde3", "a2b439b063874df0a074449c7c8616ac0880c9c5", "d122f9d77b417d322bb246bee224c306ab3469a7", "de8556c0354efc45d6b03701e1eedaf979ce0a35"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/00ecab93857c258b58cac2950290dc1c96f69302", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016982"], "venue": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "4", "journalPages": "1708-1713", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016982", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016982", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2114376863", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Given this reality, our goal is to create algorithms that learn effectively in repeated games played with minimal information. As in other applications of machine learning, the success of a learning algorithm in repeated games depends on its learning bias. To better understand what learning biases are most successful, we analyze the learning biases of previously published multi-agent learning (MAL) algorithms. We then describe a new algorithm that adapts a successful learning bias from the literature to minimal information environments. Finally, we compare the performance of this algorithm with ten other algorithms in repeated games played with minimal information.", "authors": [{"name": "Jacob W.

On one hand, SiLA is interested in directly reducing the leave-one-out error or 0-1 loss by reducing the number of mistakes on unseen examples. On the other hand, it has been shown that RELIEF could be seen as a distance learning algorithm in which a linear utility function with maximum margin was optimized. We first propose here a version of this algorithm for similarity learning, called RBS (for RELIEF-Based Similarity learning). As RELIEF, and unlike SiLA, RBS does not try to optimize the leave-one-out error or 0-1 loss, and does not perform very well in practice, as we illustrate on two UCI collections. We thus introduce a stricter version of RBS, called sRBS, aiming at relying on a cost function closer to the 0-1 loss. Experiments conducted on several datasets illustrate the different behaviors of these algorithms for learning similarities for kNN classification. The results indicate in particular that the 0-1 loss is a more appropriate cost function than the one implicitly used by RELIEF.", "authors": [{"name": "Ali Mustafa Qamar", "ids": ["34722833"]}, {"name": "\u00c9ric  Gaussier", "ids": ["1732180"]}], "inCitations": ["e38ec9f35e6a21667e4a17cb43523a1f14123593", "01dce8fd7aa015b09d0f0c14419927e661a6665d", "3536df7b196857f1959d033ebc09c19b064c9616"], "outCitations": ["6d8057ce549db311b7ddaeed8dfd934b58c1c281", "531f9f13f519cd285de16b49076bd974c0285664", "af74e4ceebfd8a9bf2e3e52ab1d262fdb2653bc4", "993d736b0174abf2f713bea9d9642b85a2313cae", "43015e9790c812bdc25bf0539b2ee4055a1882a7", "87f5c5194d4064bfeeb8bfe1708d824c7e662329", "842b62ab334def5b425b884fbc2a5bf09e31b3cc", "78947497cbbffc691aac3f590d972130259af9ce", "5a7958b418bceb48a315384568091ab1898b1640", "fb68d450b33cdaefe0f29fcf81597cd85916104a", "562df433ce6781f71da27396e15d61e1aefbd4e2", "ac81da0dac77e231cbf07136a8186f53e818793e", "7892de929fa832abd12ebaea190ac90e6f672ffc", "6772bffb14d967e8ff0274dc17365038e3383259"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/23cfb33994a625f023d9d2fbfda533b82ddd3b52", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2010.34"], "venue": "2010 Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalName": "2010 Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "183-189", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2010.34", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2010.34", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2137688742", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Existing Bayesian belief aggregation methods break several theoretical assumptions for Bayesian reasoning. More practically, existing opinion pool functions that compute a single value to represent the belief of all contributors do not represent reality well, especially in cases where there are many diverse opinions. Divergence is a natural result of combining opinions from individuals with different beliefs, backgrounds and experiences. Instead of forming a single consensus value that will average out this diversity, we find clusters of agreement for each probability distribution and propagate the cluster means throughout the network during inference. We utilize a social network that tracks the agreement between individuals and the normalized graph cut algorithm to find emerging groups of consensus in the agreement network. We leverage the agreement that occurs across multiple belief estimates to help reduce the complexity that may arise as the means are propagated throughout a belief network. By monitoring agreement over time we may also expose the variety of backgrounds that will help explain divergence in belief.

We survey existing work on the forms and meanings of questions in English and discuss the pragmatic effects resulting from an interplay between the choice of syntactic form and intonation. We propose an approach to formalization based on a notion of common ground and commitment, set in a model of situated dialogue as part of collaborative activity where we explicitly model the beliefs and intentions of both the robot and the human. Questions come about by abductively inferring an intentional structure grounded in the belief model and indicating commitments. Content planning and surface realization turn this into a question of the appropriate form.", "authors": [{"name": "Ivana  Kruijff-Korbayov\u00e1", "ids": ["1401917019"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["8da462da3da45c525aea135f78ecf06daf76eafe", "98a067775710886ee7d24f123b7a09116415ab2e", "d988c0ff9b6f023fa01c8f96f7218a30ca085de6", "f2e4296466159f96516142e6ad45d46192081f13", "4d45d7b1fc9c470b51feb2afc2f88f31ff7d1295", "96de778250305d4d10efca800a354818a03dba8c", "a833a728edc42476b948f458acd2426d1db68147", "139f815422757a786d79b1830b656c797baf88b9", "a53d1d02a09c531214f72e4af664d5f1fadb4a81", "211942e4a967697c9b3959880d3d73b2641dcb7a", "07f71eeeefe010f2297e70be0a8bbc12637875b3", "7b38a4204c37f4f87721ba4cdaa525d8972d6ce4", "fdf8aa5810493037f25d16ee8e93a0a7d09ff08f", "bea7f0c45d3f3728538e9258e2e4ec5757d1a726", "6c4be1b091059e414280755bd308fb436645e7d2"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/322cd620a1d8af28ba99bb49d422edf348ce2c63", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FSS/FSS11/paper/view/4172", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FSS/FSS11/paper/download/4172/4488"], "venue": "AAAI Fall Symposium: Question Generation", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2185736740", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Here, we present a model where the basal ganglia implement such a conditional information routing system. The basal ganglia are a set of subcortical nuclei that play a central role in cognition. Like a switchboard, the model basal ganglia direct the communication between cortical regions by alerting the destination regions to the presence of important signals coming from the source regions. This way, they can impose serial control on the massive parallel communication between cortical areas. The model also incorporates a possible mechanism by which subsequent transfers of information control the release of dopamine. This signal is used to produce novel stimulusresponse associations by internalizing the representation being transferred in the striatum. We discuss how this neural circuit can be seen as a biological implementation of a production system. This comparison highlights the basal ganglia as bridge between computational models of smallsize brain circuits and high-level characterizations of complex cognition, such as cognitive architectures.", "authors": [{"name": "Andrea  Stocco", "ids": ["1695004"]}, {"name": "Christian  Lebiere", "ids": ["1749342"]}, {"name": "John R.

In order to achieve energy efficiency of wireless devices, IEEE 802.11 protocol has designed an important scheme, Power Save Mode (PSM). This paper implements the PSM in NS-2 which is a popular discrete event simulator for analyzing the performance of network protocols. Firstly, the NS-2 patch of PSM is implemented in the WLAN with infrastructure mode. After validating the PSM implementation, we show that PSM can save wireless devices' energy while influencing bandwidth slightly. We analyze how the protocol parameters and network conditions affect the performance of PSM in terms of clients' energy consumption and energy efficiency metric. The experiment results show that the parameter configuration has a great impact on the performance of PSM.

However, this is often impossible in real applications since preparing good initial training samples is difficult and time-consuming. It is ideal and appealing for a topical crawler if it can learn knowledge concerning the target topics from the ever-changing environment and adapt itself to these changes during successive crawling process. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised clustering method for building a learnable topical crawler. Our approach employs a constrained k-means clustering algorithm to detect new samples from crawled pages, which is fed to page classifier and link predictor for updating the learned models. This approach enables topical crawling systems with incremental learning capability and in turn improves crawling performance. Comparison experiments have been carried out between our approach and another traditional relevance score based sample generation approach. The experimental results have shown that our approach achieves better performance.", "authors": [{"name": "Qing-Yao  Wu", "ids": ["31060469"]}, {"name": "Yunniing  Ye", "ids": ["31276546"]}, {"name": "Jun  Fu", "ids": ["145504600"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["338f69da188acbb8763f9f6daf71c0759f55441f", "5542fb370531b64f051496ff3c27efcbc63d31a6", "daac06a4830488f0d47278e3c0c17394646d8354", "5ee8a371fc5adc5469435020a52fb815f3b57a71"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/886d7420c3e5f12ab5dd9700d4faa7970c9e143d", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "1", "journalPages": "231-236", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212484", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212484", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2001063606", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

The objective function of LR is usually minimized by Newton-Raphson method such as using iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS). There, the inverse Hessian matrix must be calculated in each iteration step. Thus, a computational cost in the optimization of LR significantly increases as input data becomes large. To reduce the computational cost, we propose a novel optimization method of LR by directly using the non-linear conjugate gradient (CG) method. The proposed method iteratively minimizes the objective function of LR without calculation of the Hessian matrix. Furthermore, to reduce the number of iteration efficiently, the step size in the non-linear CG iteration is optimized avoiding ad hock line search, and initial values are set by ordinary linear regression analysis. In the experimental results, our method performs about 200 times faster than the other methods for a large scale dataset.", "authors": [{"name": "Kenji  Watanabe", "ids": ["51514725"]}, {"name": "Takumi  Kobayashi", "ids": ["144907434"]}, {"name": "Nobuyuki  Otsu", "ids": ["1809629"]}], "inCitations": ["4e7aa40fbc4dcc0b32addee53216f2efa5cd84fd", "8ca97a4d9532e74a693993a41b33cc6300db20d9"], "outCitations": ["45efe38ea906de376db50a86b8a11ef566821e42", "0b6f2975f33db74f0ad7954053a80ce95d42eae6", "fdb3c8e4b4dad531b6c4afcd9826f8a1527e9e5a", "a6ce051b85e7c21287de9dd53f81b4e72925e1a9", "a8bec570d0e649e58eaafb927378f88c4b023a96", "5ea8516f807a88e4d768c926f6d7a5903796e76c", "385197d4c02593e2823c71e4f90a0993b703620e", "713e9f14f23568be4a9a24c6754099a0b208f8f7", "19ca4e975fd199f3e5be2a01364a25e64a6fa20a", "668b1277fbece28c4841eeab1c97e4ebd0079700", "466daddfb6340c28cb8da548007028c8cc5df687", "8998fa28f9ed8a98ac3639218bd123d0174f5da2", "1b84b383ad59f79e607ad0f08a8a10876631a0cd", "f90e71df8f88a278b22920e2e976947e637efad8", "32e5c27a55a2481a32ce1e179ec8953712c3abc0"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/835365fbe3327ba5b75c37eaaca54513f487040d", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2011.63"], "venue": "2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops", "journalName": "2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops", "journalVolume": "1", "journalPages": "496-500", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2011.63", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2011.63", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "magId": "2149375193", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

This paper proposes an algorithm of locating order mining based on sequence number, which is suitable for mining long frequent itemsets. In order to fast search long frequent itemsets, the algorithm adopts not only traditional down search, but also the method of locating order of subset to generate candidate frequent itemsets. It has two aspects, which are different from traditional down search mining algorithm. One is that the algorithm need locate order of subsets of non frequent itemsets via down search. The other is that the algorithm uses character of attribute sequence number to compute support for only scanning database once. The algorithm may efficiently delete repeated L-candidate frequent itemsets generated by (L+1)-non frequent itemsets via locating subsets' order, whose efficiency is improved. The result of experiment indicates that the algorithm is suitable for mining long frequent itemsets, and it is faster and more efficient than present algorithms of mining long frequent itemsets.", "authors": [{"name": "Gang  Fang", "ids": ["144115424"]}, {"name": "Hong  Ying", "ids": ["145835931"]}, {"name": "Jiang  Xiong", "ids": ["143787317"]}, {"name": "Yong-Jian  Zhao", "ids": ["2156381"]}], "inCitations": ["3dcd682c30b777dd325db9572effad52901a65c3", "28ae1141c16799b76e77a5398a2df87592e242b1"], "outCitations": ["2a3e2e78bafaf5c075a10c2d9189f4423a715dd2", "6488b35f410bb1c408a90411988ed9f587419c88", "3b7ddbf235610000b215690a20d17fde102ed722", "a0145a9993ea723cc257abc1a6293b51c75c4234", "3f1542cc799a931d696b792fb5eac7a4adf0ad9f"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/531a3123a22dfcccfe0b3377f932d42168a5cdbe", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5581028"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "1", "journalPages": "403-407", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5581028", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5581028", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1986139381", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

With the aid of the micro-mechanical model of knitted fabric which characterizes the special properties of knitted fabric, the draping and buckling of a square knitted fabric sheet putting on a circular desk are successfully simulated by Multi-scale finite element methods (MsFEM) and traditional finite element method. The knitted fabric sheet is discretized with 8-nodes shell elements, which are designed for finite deformation and suffice to describe the large rotation of knitted fabric sheet during draping. For the sake of simplicity, the nodes of the knitted fabric sheet on the edge of the desk are assumed to fix.

First, most texts from those sites are abbreviated due to the constraints of limited characters in one post; second, the input usually comes in streams of large-volumes. Therefore, it is of significant importance to develop effective and efficient representations of abbreviated texts for better filtering and mining. In this paper, we introduce a novel transfer learning approach, namely transfer latent semantic learning, that utilizes a large number of related tagged documents with rich information from other sources (source domain) to help build a robust latent semantic space for the abbreviated texts (target domain). This is achieved by simultaneously minimizing the document reconstruction error and the classification error of the labeled examples from the source domain by building a classifier with hinge loss in the latent semantic space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying them to the task of classifying and tagging abbreviated texts. Experimental results on both synthetic datasets and real application datasets, including Reuters-21578 and Twitter data, suggest substantial improvements using our approach over existing ones.", "authors": [{"name": "Dan  Zhang", "ids": ["145393898"]}, {"name": "Yan  Liu", "ids": ["47909587"]}, {"name": "Richard D.

Typically, pipeline models fail to produce highly-accurate final output. On the other hand, there has been growing interest in integrated or joint models which explore mutual benefits and perform multiple subtasks simultaneously to avoid problems caused by pipeline models. However, building such systems usually increases computational complexity and requires considerable engineering. This paper presents a general, strongly-coupled, and bidirectional architecture based on discriminatively trained factor graphs for information extraction. First we introduce joint factors connecting variables of relevant subtasks to capture dependencies and interactions between them. We then propose a strong bidirectional MCMC sampling inference algorithm which allows information to flow in both directions to find the approximate MAP solution for all subtasks.

PTS technique combining can improve the PAPR statistics of an OFDM signals, but the considerable computational complexity for the required search through a high-dimensional vector space is a potential problem for implementation in the practical systems. Differential evolution (DE) is an efficient and powerful population-based stochastic search technique for solving optimization problems over continuous space, which has been widely applied in many scientific and engineering fields. Thus, to reduce the complexity for searching phase weight vector and to improve the PAPR statistics, we introduce the DE, an effective algorithm that solves various combinatorial optimization problems, to search the optimal phase weight factors. The simulation results show that the proposed DE-based PTS obtains the excellent PAPR performance with a low computational complexity.", "authors": [{"name": "Yung-Cheng  Yao", "ids": ["3313557"]}, {"name": "Ho-Lung  Hung", "ids": ["1723658"]}, {"name": "Jyh-Horng  Wen", "ids": ["1773834"]}], "inCitations": ["a23ed5afad305282447aebb68148f9375553c89b", "aa7cf93cad8f84ef61f8d845d3dd4f1619612e6f", "ec8931e143beb7dd479e17dd7dd0fb4c208be2d3", "d03e01a3864cb8244b4c05c704767f7b0bbb35b9", "55e455fd0c354034bccf8d5420973c6d97a13fe2", "d628671aa6643069960581d566eaf20a63975375", "fb7f24b0ba8c26229d5bb58e72eef28b5d6367d2", "54f03b428083e14b353e8566f0e9dfd6071521ec"], "outCitations": ["7f9ba243c76077841e290478ae2aa93cb2fbf540", "1371ee8096ddf5a0097aab3d7bc22ba1bf37a356", "bac20919e6199c3c4ba9d8c9934b837ec854f316", "e1599853598eb9b1c5676fe8ed4852079925f00c", "eb939fd421861732ed51306ee0111e324e17f6c2", "6b1b1eb2a8a8a29dea4cf45729b5264898760d8c", "5c47e67c0f796adcea8bc44acd2679e351dd0c38", "7c1e46fdb9a59847adf91845117ca57203a17eac", "350687965a9ea3b42cc2eb51be747ab71fb81b8a", "f9eb02aaa03f38c0ddf084712f29018f630b24ef", "6149765bd3c6732b563950d95869b170bc2616da", "aa67babb7362000237e7e4dd0068b0d80b36cdf6", "f7277f257dff2ba4f3789289f9a6b88a201eb053", "5c4c840efa714b0c8bc87da192fdb4d1587362bd", "9ce9992214de49dd0ab80ce8348cae3709d5c951", "9fc7d7371af6de84e4434260ebea1bf2f40abb1d", "7f2c2c88cff4c6c9ab52c70048873a996f50e1c4", "cc70e0f4e152952ae07684b0efdacf33a54abc5b", "406bdc4902749867fc7ad573e515fc3bbcb8fb50", "e6546064ec0850958580598f74b648d015d24d81"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/89d65316503fb6a5e248287668910c6f302e5e11", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016873", "http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jyh-Horng_Wen/publication/221545150_PAPR_reduction_in_OFDM_system_using_differential_evolution-based_partial_transmit_sequences_scheme/links/00b7d52b9c5df95c03000000.pdf", "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jyh-Horng_Wen/publication/221545150_PAPR_reduction_in_OFDM_system_using_differential_evolution-based_partial_transmit_sequences_scheme/links/00b7d52b9c5df95c03000000.pdf"], "venue": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "3", "journalPages": "1414-1419", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016873", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016873", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "magId": "2156863081", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

The determination factors for the next examination item in an examination room for a single examinee are determined by 1) examining time \u2014 mean time for next examination, 2) waiting time \u2014 mean waiting time for next examination available, 3) the distance between room-the mean distance moving prior examination room to next one, and 4) the priority of doctors. The Mamdani-style fuzzy inference process is applied to modeling and constructing this fuzzy system. The Java Expert System Shell (JESS) is taken to build the knowledge base and conduct the system experiment and test. Through on-site evaluation and measurement, the entire performance of examination is enhanced from 20 percent to 30 percent under the support of current examination resources. And, each examinee's examination time for a typical one-day 6-hour examination process may be reduced from 30 minutes to one hour in average dependent upon different individual case and resource constraints in each day.

This allows to learn different dependencies between tasks for different regions of the learning space. Thus, we relax the conventional hypothesis that tasks behave similarly in the whole learning space. Moreover, MT-Adaboost can learn multiple tasks without imposing the constraint of sharing the same label set and/or examples between tasks.

Features are extracted from the EEG to characterize the signal over time. We perform model selection to reduce the set of features, as the goal is to have the algorithm running on a small personal device. The chosen features are used within a supervised classifier, based on randomized forests, in order to separate the different brain states. One of the challenges of this research is to detect all seizures, while preserving a low false positive rate, and low detection latency. We present results showing we can achieve this using data from three separate animals.

These slots are related to the necessary attributes for the construction of the sequence in execution time. The robot can make specific requests on encountering unfilled slots. Temporal aspects of dialog such as barge-in property, mixed-initiative, or speech intonation control are also considered. Dialog flow is based on Dialog Acts.

In this paper, an algorithm for clustering heterogeneous data streams with uncertainty, called HU-Clustering, is proposed. A Heterogeneous Uncertainty Clustering Feature (H-UCF) is presented to describe the feature of heterogeneous data streams with uncertainty. Based on H-UCF, a probability frequency histogram is proposed to track the statistics of categorical attributes; the algorithm initially creates n clusters by k-prototypes algorithm. In order to improve clustering quality, a two phase streams clustering selection process is applied to HU-Clustering algorithm. Firstly, the candidate clustering is selected through the new similarity measure; secondly, the most similar cluster for each new arriving tuple is selected through clustering uncertainty in candidate clustering set. The experimental results show that the clustering quality of HU-Clustering is higher than that of UMicro.", "authors": [{"name": "Guo-Yan  Huang", "ids": ["1949751"]}, {"name": "Da-Peng  Liang", "ids": ["2298276"]}, {"name": "Chang-Zhen  Hu", "ids": ["31788965"]}, {"name": "Jia-Dong  Ren", "ids": ["2264954"]}], "inCitations": ["7e2f65c9118a39ef3a1cbbecaebd0747fb668c50", "8a3fbf0a5284e0a456311b6e4957d3aec381ebfa", "664bc9c63f8d88590da15ac33d3f791e1ad9626c", "36b0f3deecf85de84414181e3fdd146b9ec20d1b", "698a727d6f88d10b9327e85bc71d4d652b866d60", "2b312c9443ac0d1653adcaa40bc9d999bda79137", "fba8fcd177bca6576d2ccee32ed8c3c926bca304", "f2f0518f9035c8dcdf3ccde1973c24aebab50728", "9051af64dc6ec864b1d10979cec290747416dfc9", "2c22cb71dd466898775a7dd96418cf305a44be04", "7315fe4e44f780e8aa37ff247bd88e7bf83e46a1", "a0c2797d26cf175dbff1bddf7663cdbead90ca08", "b3f364d5424d2d71d1ba996f2e5a03e33aef1f09"], "outCitations": ["ee19cc697d0f48b8d184561dc09c09c2accb76a4", "cbc2b5ada23f785b7897a498a2697c4109be616f", "b7b19ae5bd3358afac1d1073018ba75a1020240f", "954d20f075612d2e8e82117bc69a89e302a6b02c", "3a66fa7f187170ed80a6fb88f872f65c4cadf9d0", "c7f04a9fc7de61203eaab68a2669ef15cc9247c9", "317c0f3a829ee8f0b3d7e5a915a93c52baa7a9e8", "b6d9d6c25f5b7a3689c503e7df74e937ebd5cdb8", "93c6cb9cac03a18cb785b8fe7d35c715f7792d80", "f09fd8cf1f8003f94162cea45802229aac292f40"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b7486d3515a0351386dbe2d7ed9dcf47d7010a27", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580502"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "4", "journalPages": "2059-2064", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580502", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580502", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2162352926", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

In VMI, the supplier takes the responsibility for replenishing his customers' inventories based on their consumption data, with the aim of optimizing the overall distribution and inventory costs throughout the supply chain. The objective of this IRP problem is to determine a distribution plan that minimizes average distribution and inventory costs without causing any stockout at the customers. Deterministic constant customer demand rates are assumed and therefore, a long-term cyclical approach is adopted, integrating fleet sizing, vehicle routing, and inventory management. Further, realistic side-constraints such as limited storage capacities, driving time restrictions and constant replenishment intervals are taken into account. A heuristic solution approach is proposed, analyzed and evaluated against a comparable heuristic. The heuristic solution approach is well capable of finding the appropriate cost trade-off under varying circumstances. Furthermore, when fleet sizing is not considered, the heuristic outperforms an existing heuristic in finding the two-way trade-off between distribution and inventory costs.", "authors": [{"name": "Hong-Zhen  Zheng", "ids": ["3027690"]}, {"name": "Hao-Yan  Guo", "ids": ["3205445"]}, {"name": "Xiao-Dong  Zhang", "ids": ["46447475"]}], "inCitations": ["c7faafbb57d6ddb494ff8017537fdcf90752b07a", "b43f2aeed6dad6f511c65e7ec6220bfb7d308328"], "outCitations": ["9f1da517aa7eee90e5d6bc7380af076686b4bb36", "baad8d75037106567efc5dab2d7b73335a3d05e8", "9d66856d432f513aa5090f061f697d3f65a54b13", "d534939da1dd8c5810b7d6818986724b7e975c16", "68bc23ae3777429067436034dcde07f9da532563", "39568c8e5cb978cd5433f048b6936a5fa23366ff", "770f0713fed474fd2d26b3738962b2462eb66242", "fa9b024667b39f3ec921cac59c1c6fff19a7e158", "68cba47c2b7899a8922b9093d1e3ef7bceea9f99", "19fa14959c13d40c8ce29695d252a1ebe73cc269", "7e38b5a17e0db7a5a617c77769332436fcf0321b", "f96d396f7d8290a16ea8d3b030769cba0c5346f8"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3ec10bc9eaa6ade39d48987688acb372b889233e", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "3", "journalPages": "1393-1398", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212292", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212292", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2150932509", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

This can be explained by spite, where the agent's utility not only increases in the agent's surplus but also decreases as the other bidders' surpluses increase. Spite can stem from long-term benefits from making competitors worse off and from inherent psychological effects. There have been important recent game-theoretic analyses of spiteful bidding assuming all agents are equally spiteful. We present, to our knowledge, the first auction analysis in the more realistic setting where bidders may be spiteful to different extents. We show that the equilibrium bidding function can still be written in the same form\u2014except that the spite factor is replaced by an 'expressed' spite factor. This leads to bidders expressing spites that are higher or lower than their true spite depending on others' spite. Perhaps surprisingly, in the two-bidder case, the mapping from true spite to expressed spite is the same across all common auction mechanisms. Furthermore, even with two bidders, important properties of symmetric-spite settings cease to hold: the allocation can be inefficient and the revenue ranking may reverse between first- and second-price auctions. We also show that in sealed-bid auctions under asymmetric valuation distributions, there can be a \"bargaining problem\" in selecting bids. Finally, we study the generalization where agents can have different extents of spite toward different other bidders.", "authors": [{"name": "Ankit  Sharma", "ids": ["27133296"]}, {"name": "Tuomas  Sandholm", "ids": ["145714168"]}], "inCitations": ["e26d5118002afb20d35cb1af7b574d358ce95c88", "88268d3c8e50434731dbcff1a9181929c77f1e38", "b7a498d7c061f507a7f3490a9c8b074dff4777b6", "77d5312bc04a10a835eaf1fa630d987bfd5e6274", "213733ae5cf0c379db7e912a54ad58bae8130892", "6dc51919d984f8d1018904a7b8851bf52ea6ce3c", "2174df42e8261e2d08e37ed04ce02504586e4694", "564fc691a9203d2f9e68ca5d582c6f0bdf3fb9e9", "cb3707219e62029d44a6f66080ae75aca59d6a49", "8b477d5bf99eb7e1a8959bfd5330bc401402b244"], "outCitations": ["78ca44e57a33accda0570c07fe01a50edfafee03", "e7c485b739ef4693401da3871da63546bc8e9540", "672de5781c49a40436f61e57d3e2a8ad04f68704", "cb46d15cff6063324acfb16a2ddbf69235022ee1", "436afb0ef424c902323329d339a5dbe3790f0472", "1ce4afe9c9f49cc765c10901130487eac321dc10", "93a5adb51b68e9bc2a802932b14f2783d9b70823", "607fd7609d180bd8f23a5f0c5d12a541baa0b870", "504f4fa57fcaab84429c41b9a0bfab7d417c65b9", "2cc0ba373af01179f293f3323b975c357d27ca36", "9ca5c5993bf98cd1e6100cfc67d3f8492fe24577"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3b77a60c7730a124d39174fc06b29ce5920da007", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/asymmetricSpite.aaai10.pdf", "http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/asymmetricSpite.aaai10.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1728", "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ankits/asymmetricSpite-aaai10.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1728/2109"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "867-873", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1721487711", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

The most dose-limiting factor in radiotherapy is the radiation-induced lung toxicity (RILT). RILT is generally measured semi-quantitatively, by a dyspnea, or shortness-of-breath, score. In general, about 20-30% of patients develop RILT several months after treatment, and in about 70% of the patients the delivered dose is insufficient to control the tumor growth. Ideally, if the RILT score would be known in advance, then the dose treatment plan for the low-toxicity-risk patients could be adjusted so that higher dose is delivered to the tumor to better control it. A number of possible predictors of RILT have been proposed in the literature, including dose-related and clinical/demographic patient characteristics available prior to radiotherapy. In addition, the use of imaging features -- which are noninvasive in nature - has been gaining momentum. Thus, anatomic as well as functional/metabolic information from CT and PET scanner images respectively are used in daily clinical practice, which provide further information about the status of a patient. In this study we assessed whether machine learning techniques can successfully be applied to predict post-radiation lung damage, proxied by dyspnea score, based on clinical, dose-related (dosimetric) and image features. Our dataset included 78 NSCLC patients. The patients were divided into two groups: no-deterioration-of-dyspnea, and deterioration-of-dyspnea patients. Several machine-learning binary classifiers were applied to discriminate the two groups.

Normally, the previous statistical TC algorithms treat an email as a single plain-text document, ignoring the multi-field feature of email documents. This paper investigates the multi-field feature, and proposes a multi-field learning (MFL) approach for email spam filtering. The MFL approach divides the complex TC problem of multi-field document into several sub-problems, and conquers each sub-problem separately. At online learning, multi-scorer is learned separately within its text field according to online supervised feedbacks. At online predicting, multi-scorer's output scores are combined to predict the new document's category. The MFL framework is a general frame to combine scorers implemented by any statistical TC algorithms. However, previous TC algorithms often require great training or updating time, which are impractical for large-scale email systems. Considering the space-time spending of email spam filtering, a string-frequency index (SFI) binary TC algorithm is proposed, which is based on the straightforward conditional probability and has low space-time complexity for both online learning and online predicting. The experimental results on TREC spam track show that the performances of online Bayesian and relaxed online SVMs algorithms can be improved by the MFL approach. Especially, the proposed SFI algorithm can achieve the state-of-the-art performance at greatly reduced computational cost within the MFL framework.", "authors": [{"name": "Wuying  Liu", "ids": ["34624653"]}, {"name": "Lin  Wang", "ids": ["46660076"]}, {"name": "Ting  Wang", "ids": ["1749687"]}], "inCitations": ["f8db4b7425ee9ecad7f77bb3d53faf33ea276641", "1df8281dd7865a5b0d15b9e5ff14a33f3ceb8fb9", "a3577a43e77492c59b1241e063da36666e441464", "6757aa3d6e474004b38237415814962c0d540b30"], "outCitations": ["1a2dfeb37b8f6f0fac18ba19e7b7a2fb9b4dded8", "e45923dc26b10e043e6de124cc2bd96e8a28a989", "29fa9b903dbd8d19e39b0d7fb06efc6a1907dfdb", "d87837b91d057ee6b458a439dce0fc904e969214", "685b3d2aacda1059fdeb6c7c7723f4b3dac94ce5", "a0456c27cdd58f197032c1c8b4f304f09d4c9bc5", "bd470476427bd459179d7d2c94e5b2c93ac0abd7", "6b20af22b0734757d9ead382b201a65f9dd637cc", "de7bfd54b065b1fdce26c11447ce6ee938b69b3e", "7be97249e88516058f34ad3836c16096413bd02b", "93bf608cb746029cf1e703cc9284d3231c16167c"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/22e5041836a549878aa0797d204a67357da839f9", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580676"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "6", "journalPages": "3335-3340", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580676", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580676", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2051095246", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

RRW has been shown to achieve better performance on functional module discovery in protein-protein interaction networks than Markov Clustering Algorithm (MCL). There is however little work applying RRW to community detection in social networks. We ran RRW on some real-world social networks that are well-documented in the literature.

To prove be independent of view angle, the relationship model of the walking azimuth angle and the reference view has been modeled. We transform the walking angle to the most similar canonical views angle. Three canonical views angles are adopted in this paper.

However, there is abundant empirical evidence that suggests that learners typically do not adaptively modify their behavior, thus suggesting that they engage in what is called dysregulated behavior. Dysregulated learning is a new term that is used to describe a class of behaviors that learners use that lead to minimal learning. Examples of dysregulated learning include failures to: (1) encode contextual demands, (2) deploy effective learning strategies, (3) modify and update internal standards, (4) deal with the dynamic nature of the task, (5) metacognitive monitor the use of strategies and repeatedly make accurate metacognitive judgments, and (6) intelligently adapt behavior during learning so as to maximize learning and understanding of the instructional material.

Methods and Materials: A large number of plans were generated by varying the DV constraints (input features) on the OARs (multi-plan framework), and the OAR complications in the plans (plan properties) were modeled as a function of the imposed DV constraint settings, which were used as input to machine learning (ML) algorithms. These ML approaches were used to model two OAR complications following head-and-neck and whole pelvis/prostate intensity-modulated radiation therapy, xerostomia and Grade 2 rectal bleeding. Two-fold cross-validation was used for model verification and mean errors were reported. Results: In the head and neck case, the mean absolute prediction error of the saliva flow rate normalized to the pre-treatment saliva flow rate was 0.42% with a 95% confidence interval of [0.41%, 0.43%]. In the whole pelvis/prostate case, an average prediction accuracy of 97.04% with a 95% confidence interval of [96.67%, 97.41%] was achieved for Grade 2 rectal bleeding complications.

Much of this work, however, has focused on the structural aspects of narrative rather than the process of narrative comprehension undertaken by users. Motivated by approaches in natural language discourse generation where explicit models of a reader\u2019s mental state are often used to select and organize content in multisentential text, the work described here seeks to build an explicit model of a reader\u2019s inferencing process when reading (or participating in) a narrative. In this paper, we present a method for generating causal and intentional inferences, in the form of sequences of events, from a narrative discourse. We define a representation for the discourse, the sequence of discourse content, and show how it may be translated to a story representation, the reader\u2019s plan. We define cognitive criteria of necessitated inferences with regards to these representations, and show how a partial order planner can determine which inferences are enabled. The inference generation is motivated by findings in cognitive studies of discourse processing, and we provide support for their online generation by readers in a pilot study.", "authors": [{"name": "James  Niehaus", "ids": ["2194834"]}, {"name": "Robert Michael Young", "ids": ["145513579"]}], "inCitations": ["c634c26141613b3b61308bfbf448f241f31b0fee", "957a8e9f67b7da0d0805d613ace6d09d8d3675b6", "8715acdc7fd47f5b527e5303158f59975fedad00", "efda4dedd30090b8d743cc5f4fc642b990872036", "ec04ce2fc10d67fd5f69d27608d34660b9fc149a", "8857880d7372b7873eea1511b798fa9b0a31b903", "53dda6dcea420697e78b53dc0baaf494ab28b90f", "d457a9703a19ddeb47820e57aafc7835de6af328", "7b3b0136902c097fea4f29b02da594aa205cba91", "29a7bb2ff104e7f4b5cea52c4d6e8e708d5b516d", "c5b56b5b3eb539e82ed937f926f834497d56fcea", "9460cd173b7dfb539860bbf1f6da73700a45a521", "8ddf481fe2d66e1dc36cbc2f8665545a4bae79ca", "a351b59f062e49d6a97a13c90df4fe88bace14d0", "aef2e830dcc9c40a401bd82c5776478e0d23932c", "9809ecb20493011318b1bc876087ff4cd6de1ed5", "c52e330c5b2fce0b70bb4ec9d007ea169218a9d7", "4dea78e66dd240bebbe6960cdb99ab8336a20823", "46b812e334d10d8a37fc0271fcfd5fb1b42891ca", "47724f8629ebb5c626c512ef2f79f438d8fcc963", "f1923c291ded857b258a98841b4110e01187c397"], "outCitations": ["84b0b2db7a35384bba2c4e266ae573ef5e3f1798", "d2e564f6f58cf3f76028ea8a8fcdb1367bdb897b", "6e1bd5758be5495141d56de31c28d57f55c56f3e", "436b11367eaed2c99b967f3dea63f5ec989ded1d", "5842f5e992eff7750d54b3fcdd5853bc9cf7cf98", "af2a6bcf606aa21de887b9ce15152eed2191b562", "dafe201083c0a57e978756d292d9ff73a86890db", "fbf0a0cc42288ae6b96b48b0a115534ef7c8a8cc", "4611eff86360ce7204b6949bf71c868de74ebdc8", "632302f310f5d5e90ed38b808a2339e44f80d9a3", "5945da974a1373eb2cbfd0a37c21392351904218", "55ec99d2b74e85bbbeb22931da72473c2da0c227", "a95da8005cd677cc54d0975115f30bbd2e7704a2", "f92fbdcf5dbd68f85a217c65f502782c39b8dd1b", "2a99c350f73f54ef78493481f533dc1b9d8455a1", "6d185f5cfc7e1df9105459a68e96f82fbb047f52", "e150018c6612243403a7b033a3e8ab5593932cad", "311b6dfee1974691a4c125a866d4a5872cff2546", "c648f156be45c4aeceb23fc379a2f49d8310356a"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b7c57fcd251cdafc4f3299cfdfcf52c7037cfeb8", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Spring/2009/SS-09-06/SS09-06-014.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Spring/2009/ss09-06-014.php"], "venue": "AAAI Spring Symposium: Intelligent Narrative Technologies II", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "83-90", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2291530570", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

In this paper, one inter-concepts strong association and dependency multi-label annotation method for video semantic concept is presented. In video content analysis process, concepts are often correlated. One concept in one shot are usually dependent on others concepts in the same shot. Co-occurrence of several semantic concepts could imply the presence of other concepts. Unlike previous approaches only to take into count the pair concepts correlations, the proposed methods exploits label correlations between concepts including more than three. For generation the inter-concepts association and dependency rules, join and prune techniques are employed to get potential semantic concept associations in one shot. Compound labels are considered as a single label in annotation step. Experiment results on real-world multi-label media data show that the performance of proposed method is relative satisfied.", "authors": [{"name": "Wei  Wei", "ids": ["50770492"]}, {"name": "Wen-Qing  Liu", "ids": ["49663528"]}, {"name": "Li-Li  Li", "ids": ["2215061"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["ae11fe0736e1fed743b6ad389d3843c6d682a27d", "1fed53a5e9795530c7f326d61582727c1617b644", "fb4f9130248c8534afa0dc76b6d62149158fd792", "a6ccfe1ac31444fb5a0d32b58182e0fb1b17c0e4", "57af20b27db58aad6238eb137c293534cf79286e", "b1cec9751c8b5c90ae53a97c2b436dbe6e43153e", "896b9c1551b7ffa347baed144582ec3b5d88f703", "d6fb24b719fec0ffc285b4d3ed8d52d828f1760f", "e7a07c3aaef303850e5a1fcc81bb44f6d2db6696", "be58fa2558c8afd8e179f0ce22c371d0908913f1", "6fe8c5bf8dddaadf10c765133d38dfef5714347f"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6ee3fbd2e6b4b95fa67f650c1d3c3a3d2d98b4c8", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "4", "journalPages": "2453-2457", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212195", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212195", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2129072205", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Unfortunately, these algorithms all require access to a planner that computes a near optimal policy, and while many traditional MDP algorithms make this guarantee, their computation time grows with the number of states. We show how to replace these over-matched planners with a class of sample-based planners\u2014whose computation time is independent of the number of states\u2014without sacrificing the sample-efficiency guarantees of the overall learning algorithms. To do so, we define sufficient criteria for a sample-based planner to be used in such a learning system and analyze two popular sample-based approaches from the literature. We also introduce our own sample-based planner, which combines the strategies from these algorithms and still meets the criteria for integration into our learning system. In doing so, we define the first complete RL solution for compactly represented (exponentially sized) state spaces with efficiently learnable dynamics that is both sample efficient and whose computation time does not grow rapidly with the number of states.", "authors": [{"name": "Thomas J.

Readers care about these narratives because they are passionately interested in the topic and want to read about the specific details of the event. In other words, they care about the data and want to read a story that presents that data to them. However, in order to be compelling these narratives cannot merely repeat the data, rather they must tell a story from the data. In this paper, we will present a model for data-driven story-telling and discuss StatsMonkey, a system that automatically writes baseball stories from raw baseball game numerical data available online. We will show that a machine can generate interesting, readable stories and that it can make editorial decisions about what aspects of a situation to highlight. Further we will show that a machine can determine in what manner those aspects should be shared.", "authors": [{"name": "Nicholas D. Allen", "ids": ["48771066"]}, {"name": "John R.

This study uses the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method for solving the inspection allocation problem in reentrant production systems. In the original PSO, it is very quick to find a solution, but it is easy to trap into a locally optimal solution. In this study, we add the mutation scheme borrowed from the genetic algorithm (GA) method for searching the position of optimal fitness function value from each particle. A comparison between the original PSO and PSO with mutation is made in terms of solution performance. In addition, we compare our proposed method with the GA method discussed in the literature for the inspection allocation problem in reentrant production systems, results show that the PSO method almost can find the optimal solution, and its execution time is less than that of the GA method.", "authors": [{"name": "Hsin  Rau", "ids": ["49839249"]}, {"name": "Kuo-Hua  Cho", "ids": ["2473374"]}], "inCitations": ["4f51bb6afdee3d5df1cf3782d73332e6caee17f2", "b5802874a841b12da7b7671a40ac845d4e2b8510", "669a0bb56adfea98d33eec7ebbbbeca7a8d0b215", "feb8e18ff59e4e8dc5c490ccb443d782284c87e2"], "outCitations": ["6ba524fef495a5d20e638038194bcfef6dd62270", "df3d9e8a494861a73ef01cac1070eda8bd7f18da", "7ac2fcf406c6506ad0aeea0b4254002f7bd677f0", "bc0bb756d310f57fa6a11aa1a152f465a23404f9", "36d50216ab3343265d24eeabd31055b001080603", "8263efcbc5e6b3c7c022b1131038b888babc8548", "812caf8bebeb8ac7b4ebcb4baddf5cbc008fb965", "7d3efebc31125e72872b8144a5d6bbe11afe8d40"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7ed63946b232316821e57018e8895fd345fc4db6", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016881"], "venue": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "3", "journalPages": "1025-1030", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016881", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016881", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2147546963", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

This paper focuses on one critical step in respecting privacy in a digital environment, that of understanding the context associated with each digital transaction.

The micro-step method is typically used to reduce the vibration and to obtain high resolution motor steps, which divides a single step into many micro-steps. PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) is the most common method to control the micro-step motor, but the equivalent magnetic circuit taking into account the localized saturation throughout the hybrid step motor is a non-linear model. This paper presents the development of a non-linear FPGA based driver for controlling five-phase hybrid step motor. The application circuit we developed is aimed for use in a low cost system. Simulations were done, and circuit analysis tests were carried out to verify our design, using prototype circuit boards. Low vibration and high resolution steps are achieved by using our nonlinear micro-step control method.", "authors": [{"name": "Shyh-Ming  Jong", "ids": ["3487744"]}, {"name": "Shun-Te  Hsiao", "ids": ["2547943"]}, {"name": "Yuan  Kang", "ids": ["66532872"]}], "inCitations": ["d7170efc698ff43fd795ba45dd4816670c91c7d8"], "outCitations": ["d262fa0a761163ffd2bf4d2935515ebd5f454145", "5ba1774bfa422ec60c429ce81d63bd2de1e5c9a9", "54256bf2f4c843f511ac544f3208ac5afd7ae499", "6445a30ffd7307b81e9d30db28b73dd67f53cd63", "9c699ed0ac9657380329f367b9420b8fff68fb40"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7a6878946106bfe65b702e083cd273790283253f", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580856"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "5", "journalPages": "2543-2548", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580856", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580856", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2047535066", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

NSCT is developed recently and can offer a trait of multidirection, flexible multiscale and shift-invariant, which can capture the intrinsic geometrical structures perfectly, and fuzzy set theory is a useful tool for handling the uncertainty in the images, and the proposed algorithm accepts advantages of NSCT and fuzzy set theory as a basis for image enhancement. Firstly, decompose the source remote sensing image in highpass subbands and lowpass subbands by NSCT. Secondly, map each highpass subband into corresponding fuzzy plane using membership function with different constraints and implement fuzzy contrast enhancement in fuzzy domain for each fuzzy plane. Finally, transform the fuzzy domain to NSCT domain and reconstruct the enhanced image from the modified NSCT coefficients. Compared with some methods, the simulation results and analysis show that the proposed algorithm obviously outperforms in both Signal-to-Noise Ratio(SNR) and visual quality, and effectively enhances the detail and texture information of remote sensing image.", "authors": [{"name": "Guo-Zun  Men", "ids": ["1777134"]}, {"name": "Jian-Lei  Yang", "ids": ["2219958"]}, {"name": "Jie  Zhao", "ids": ["144595250"]}], "inCitations": ["00404ef37b88c94c4fd6be796e482d04ccc7979a", "d4378616711ad69ba871a55641a7500066b654ac", "30473e1aba220e4f621aee4722bb5d38313c3427", "20fbcaca4c05fa53c17f7991fd752be120c53632", "712b5792883d8ecdfb011ba4f5288948e46318a4", "1822db6c96110a380cbf1f98d336d9dcfc6dab2c"], "outCitations": ["aff1898e655a382d121e185cdf838e99f3262d0c", "ea23db03389168a7bb6ab481d956ecc20c307704", "762cd00d76e44f80bc4393966511cc723bbb6377", "829f91fb0a34359ee11f6be4019ba74113448316", "aed0004e4d52d48ff39681fd0bb6b5483608b00a", "73dcd58d5821cc2ab20facecc1e49f8ade8bbe65", "23c5f46f7e780edd31158a894496c34c9bd94eba", "15b006abc4cbdb357518e4b3c933bc9e08a8227e", "83074157d165b6245915508d891b2d0cd066f3ad", "ad9c2b36dd0fb3524f14f75ac3e31c56e6df5d99", "ab9aed8c62b1a452dfc1f6d42b097891d55b374a", "04f7769cf0908101af532b02428928baccb2c4d3", "a020a9028a5bf058a5d0e1d1d6d1abfba4c50151", "1cfac0792d0a47d974ea27b6b0a4fb030036fc7f", "5edf0a2cd8bd61603fe6d138a8043f18a505ce42", "ce87cdf0195ddcd057ce127f1ba9f62e9d863c3a", "5cc5e75a49d635133330852ee2afa76fc07e2cb3", "58c48e93441562eb2121cf5132b5f1231cfe0789", "8f0dad2217ced4af0da0ccfb4458224884324e71", "80618139f73ab7c298e64ccda0e6f5e09f141f17", "fb3142167f1dea8a1546d16c8ab81ea0487f1cd3"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/294083de709b3a16b8c2380868bad5c73f82a849", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580569"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "2", "journalPages": "735-740", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580569", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580569", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "magId": "1973093243", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

It is a problem that requires a larger, more complete database, understanding of key actors and their interactions in a dynamic environment. These methods exist in the areas of Data Mining, Machine Learning, Network Analysis, and Multi-agent systems. Using these methods, it is possible to create a model which is unique to detecting and preventing human trafficking. These methods can give applicable and successful solutions for different components of the problem of human trafficking. The goal is to build an intelligent system to enable collaboration and analysis, to identify and profile victims, traffickers, buyers, and exploiters, to predict human trafficking patterns, and to disrupt and destabilize human trafficking networks. In this paper, I will outline how some of these methods may be able to help analyze and model the dynamic phenomenon of human trafficking. The purpose is to see whether, using intelligent systems and appropriate collaboration and analysis tools, optimized intervention strategies can be created to profile victims and traffickers as well as impact, dissolve, and disrupt the human trafficking network in such a way that the network is unable to recover.", "authors": [{"name": "Shreya  Amin", "ids": ["30350601"]}], "inCitations": ["098ca9a1f685a073010ac642701fbf7bce56507d", "a83f7e5d1a242c515d1e31f5eac45cd54f4f889e", "aa2b4a62cc4e64378ec33057e54c3dc1da1f00fe", "009187e2106a10559709b0645af303edcddafb6c"], "outCitations": ["70ee44786510db7c361aeaab6f37cc008bc9701e", "bee570503aaa0ed5bc5dd4cf6aa742df0b5cef87", "6fadc426e598ee1f1f006a82442cdc0eb5d0dadb", "0384c21defc6bfa9dfa15b17a49945adc21e36c7", "a73f4e905834f72ecd7e65c88aebebaea1153fd0", "0e5aaed4737e611a47b3fbfa130094582f9f128b"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/471afcbcecf25edf1d7ccad6f6447976479de4a6", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS10/paper/download/1155/1341", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS10/paper/view/1155"], "venue": "AAAI Spring Symposium: Artificial Intelligence for Development", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2403875563", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

While a human can recognize faces easily, automated face recognition remains a great challenge in computer-based automated recognition research. One difficulty in face recognition is how to handle the variations in expression, pose, and illumination when only a limited number of training samples are available. In this paper, an Improved Principal Component Analysis (IPCA) is proposed for face recognition. Initially the eigenspace is created with eigenvalues and eigenvectors. From this space, the eigenfaces are constructed, and the most relevant eigenfaces have been selected using IPCA. With these eigenfaces, the input images are be classified based on Euclidian distance. The proposed method was tested on ORL face database. Experimental results on this database demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method for face recognition with less misclassification in comparison with previous methods.", "authors": [{"name": "E.

As a result, illegal reproduction of digital information started to pose a real problem. Digital watermarking has been regarded as an effective solution to protect various kinds of digital contents against illegal use. In this paper, a watermarking technique which applies the discrete cosine transformation and z-score transformation is presented. In order to improve the performance of watermarking technique, a genetic algorithm is used to search proper parameters which are used to control the watermark strength. Experimental results demonstrates that the proposed technique is able to withstand a variety of attacks.", "authors": [{"name": "Chih-Chin  Lai", "ids": ["38243685"]}, {"name": "Ci-Fong  Jhan", "ids": ["3239115"]}, {"name": "Wei-Shun  Wang", "ids": ["3240964"]}], "inCitations": ["de426f281d372060e110beca7656c23b18e51f4f", "22aade78d2e9a7bfaead3e2ccdf983620e332e01", "5bb924532364da33b20814d94e782398317797fe", "33ffe4f59ab160702d1a5c1ff90881c82b141119", "5305013c6d5f02074d8d7d0fa62b451aae9be783"], "outCitations": ["a5eaa0b77d774745409499be2a2f16c506156161", "4a4012cbcc0cca9dcbb4708bf98601135b5d3b74", "65cbabdd671aa9a5d1682502e1e974d329364658", "f51afa2745947c11300c65ce001dc6fb2ddd5c2e", "41227e1a654638b8a612f04d2030c94e37426f96", "d83b9e9a9551356fc85d3e2a09ef8375febbef2f", "d5c85d6a8df40a37502e761b2e3c933f326cc414", "1d668ec6341c376bcc7f8a7100c04d5606ce2062", "20b3a1a95729509e461776a1a9f1b7dda62d94fd", "b972a0b133d4c43f5a5664695653b1da84c0b3c3", "e8c1ae2c6d973fdfc1c89d3a5ba3394a1b122aa6", "cb3bdef1f1efbd31932d49749f12bb358414e20e"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e159c9c411afd3ab5c5b27a36e316a89cf1ff7db", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580755"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "6", "journalPages": "2933-2937", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580755", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580755", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "magId": "2060200481", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

RFID tags are a powerful mechanism for object identification, and can facilitate the compilation of detailed object histories and pedigrees. Since RFID tags communicate with the reader through open air in an automated, wireless manner, they are poor authenticators. Furthermore, they have a small microchip on board that offer functionality that can be used for security purposes. This chip functionality makes it possible to verify the authenticity of a product and hence to detect and prevent counterfeiting. In order to be successful for these security purposes, RFID tags have to be resistant against many attacks, in particular against cloning of the tag. Therefore, RFID tags are vulnerable to elementary cloning and counterfeiting attacks. In this paper, we survey and remedy the technologies used for RFID tags against counterfeiting. In the first section, we present an overview of the RFID tags counterfeiting issue. In the second section, we survey the existing methods which investigate how an RFID-tag can be made unclonable. In the third section, we compare and contrast the pros and cons of those existing methods and also identify the discrepancy areas which require further enhancement. In the fourth section, we propose some design principles and guidelines for improvement of the existing methods.

However, when these sub-problem share some common variables, it is not sufficient to simply solve each sub-problem in isolation. We develop a technology for such problems, and use it to address the challenge of finding the concentrations of the chemicals that appear in a complex mixture, based on its one-dimensional 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrum. As each chemical involves clusters of spatially localized peaks, this requires finding the shifts for the clusters and the concentrations of the chemicals, that collectively produce the best match to the observed NMR spectrum. Here, each sub-problem requires finding the chemical concentrations and cluster shifts that can appear within a limited spectrum range; these are coupled as these limited regions can share many chemicals, and so must agree on the concentrations and cluster shifts of the common chemicals. This task motivates CEED: a novel extension to the Cross-Entropy stochastic optimization method constructed to address such partially decomposable problems. Our experimental results in the NMR task show that our CEED system is superior to other well-known optimization methods, and indeed produces the best-known results in this important, real-world application.", "authors": [{"name": "Siamak  Ravanbakhsh", "ids": ["2111187"]}, {"name": "Barnab\u00e1s  P\u00f3czos", "ids": ["1719347"]}, {"name": "Russell  Greiner", "ids": ["143686063"]}], "inCitations": ["7dd7f5edf27a16ccecd9851310a4d30f6e3e2cc3"], "outCitations": ["e165c9a87c3fab6c77534dc499f77928cc857b99", "0e8302c77ee8b9aa8b36011ad083c03a4c21db84", "f20e686d89a62cd05867bd86c935d0a149d22c9d", "c4f675cdb7d03aa1458091e4b1cf04e492ffc9f5", "4f607f03272e4d62708f5b2441355f9e005cb452", "7883aaa97c60ba15f283845fd98f0847be71af73", "4ec07dd3fbd9b0cc5459b8f19ab0599cfe000ddf", "5c5e69387020d7ca7d49487ca841958dc5e08ce6", "2832311921070ea7efd23860086a4b5cd64a0776", "04955809d8b9472ce26bddaee7bf23340d6be97e", "3744110be1b657ab6335ade4f43224a33d3edd87", "c3ce0c36a531d1a9fe98f44f4b3bd28927392178", "ba56155267c29d1b540e089df044db8f22c55a9a", "1d0896c621aad9a44942a26b916ee75c6cafb147", "6fbe1ed74633fe93eb4312f2fff0f73d5bbdc787", "bdede1e17c947540b50e6e2db9e8467ddc6e7336", "4c987ffb492e44acc010cbeb2347b92e257d7b59"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/30187c73042b0bf36a43a472f6df7e5fdff35476", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://papersdb.cs.ualberta.ca/~papersdb/uploaded_files/1044/additional_CEED.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1848/2196", "http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~mravanba/presentations/AAAI_ceed_presentation.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1848"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1280-1286", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "313246375", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

We formalize what it means for a cloning manipulation to be successful (which turns out to be a surprisingly delicate issue), and, for a number of prominent voting rules, characterize the preference profiles for which a successful cloning manipulation exists.

In this work, we present an efficient face recognition method which can solve the above two problems with single training sample. At first, the effect of the lighting variation is effectively eliminated by the Mutil-Scale Retinex algorithm. The Active Appearance Model is adopted to extract the facial block feature to establish the component-based face recognition system. Different from other methods which construct the various classifiers corresponding to the specific facial expression, the proposed method decreases the weights of some dominated facial features which are affected by the severe facial expression. By learning a block weighting support vector machine, the component based approach is achieved. The proposed algorithm has two advantages: (1) only single one face training image is needed to train the classifier; (2) by using the facial block features with lower data dimensions, the proposed system is more computational efficiency. In particular, the proposed method achieves 97.94% face recognition accuracy when only using one training sample on the Yale B database. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has reliable recognition rate when face images are under illumination and facial expression variations.", "authors": [{"name": "Ching-Liang  Lu", "ids": ["1928862"]}, {"name": "Luo-Wei  Tsai", "ids": ["1752605"]}, {"name": "Yuan-Kai  Wang", "ids": ["1975131"]}, {"name": "Kuo-Chin  Fan", "ids": ["143961578"]}], "inCitations": ["5ba4a6ce1cc025e7fd88659a60698f0e68176aa6", "db861322aa584dcbd71c3d70660edfdc4464e0d9", "5b121330ce6a6e0bc3a31091ac2626d00523acdd", "d578fb228576e06ad57a2163d48f43b6a60aa663", "f6b9dfa54e60ab573f7747f621c3a74903f0fdec", "df1a10668eaad727ec3fdf0d5df405bbe29392c9", "4b85332dc60ab65f0770a71ef7cbe5a1fd32d4c7"], "outCitations": ["af92e5b741d105236536d6f5fabca4ce5fb9b79f", "b47a973fec75e399f8530da5aa51deea271e5fb2", "57e562cf99b3dfbb6baa5bbf665aa6fd97ffe8ca", "b2c48bfbd582e345e93ebdc1afc8d9416369555f", "b932f131bc1ae2fcf2876610bb0a05d28518c773", "ed2ad7dfdb82039f63908b20dd736a92b6fdf3d5", "43b249b6398cf759cebde761c97aac557ba48450", "75817de6d43064c2a48c32efc0694f2ab4aa15dc", "219fd359c33cc072a46788d82ee64513356bc285", "601d11967c0e11abdf1156c4a3375110a5613885", "2f77c0908716b0febfda19ff6a0e2970c23af440", "044d83026c6c5c0bf88226c8066d4a205e4e531d", "be31fd4d39df0467f3cab58e9378eaaf7007ed4b", "ecac3da2ff8bc2ba55981467f7fdea9de80e2092", "921975b4df20b605ab98988da13fac5a0d45cc6c", "b5789082094ef36cf18b8f0365437977092bc878", "248fb34a10dcd3cfb7e606692b920e4bbca0ea6a", "84ca8611f9051789aefeaedaaeb8a2188f8e53a7", "c1cd4b045f47c567ea6ecb997f415a847b4982ab", "acd0e8aedd2bb81a0cd8714ac350f9aac67c33ed", "c973b7c453012deb689b8d1b6a995f956c6351e1", "3ffbc912de7bad720c995385e1fdc439b1046148", "f652cb159a2cf2745aabcbf6a7beed4415e79e34"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7f5d8ab0d90143db4338771be6fe1c2ec0772967", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yuan-Kai_Wang/publication/221544841_Robust_face_recognition_under_illumination_and_facial_expression_variations/links/540401570cf2bba34c1c3016.pdf", "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580693"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "6", "journalPages": "3257-3263", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580693", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580693", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1967875291", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

The typhoon records in Taiwan before 2000 were used as the database for reference, and the records after the year 2000 were predicted using CBR and FT derived from the database. Three scenarios were calculated, the first is CBR with four parameters, maximum wind speed, minimum atmospheric pressure, maximum wind speed in typhoon center and lowest atmospheric pressure near typhoon center. The second scenario includes the four parameters with rainfall and calculated by CBR. The third scenario uses the fuzzy calculation with four parameters. The successful rate of prediction for the three methods was 12.5%, 37.5%, and 57%.

One can make better decisions by choosing a good solution provided through this mechanism. We choose a local city to illustrate our method.

With the development of IE methodologies, a lot of information extraction tools have been proposed and are playing an important role in information processing. However, the efficiency of these tools may not be satisfactory to users. One of those important reasons is that most of these IE tools extract information from a single document. In this paper, we propose a extracting method which combine current single document based Named Extraction (NE) tool with a multi-document based Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN) for multi-document IE. The RBFNN is trained by a minimization of the Localized Generalization Error Model (L-GEM) to enhance its generalization capability. We collect a set of news pages from the Internet for the same news. Interested names are extracted by the most frequent name extracted by the NE tool. Numbers and other information, that can not be extracted by NE tool, will be extracted by the RBFNN by a pattern classification approach. The scenario of company layoff is used as an example to show how we extract the corresponding company name, company major location and the number of layoffs.

One way to quantify the uncertainy of a QSAR prediction is to predict the conditional density of the activity given the structure instead of a point estimate. If a conditional density estimate is available, it is easy to derive prediction intervals of activities. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate and compare three methods for conditional density estimation for their suitability in QSAR modeling. In contrast to traditional methods for conditional density estimation, they are based on generic machine learning schemes, more specifically, class probability estimators. Our experiments show that a kernel estimator based on class probability estimates from a random forest classifier is highly competitive with Gaussian process regression, while taking only a fraction of the time for training. Therefore, generic machine-learning based methods for conditional density estimation may be a good and fast option for quantifying uncertainty in QSAR modeling.", "authors": [{"name": "Fabian  Buchwald", "ids": ["3257548"]}, {"name": "Tobias  Girschick", "ids": ["8341908"]}, {"name": "Eibe  Frank", "ids": ["143713826"]}, {"name": "Stefan  Kramer", "ids": ["145471896"]}], "inCitations": ["33c6d8b7fd61f9410a0cb42b0b090124701bfedf", "bd6b5fb31e9afe61392c853ae87ffa17600ecbf5", "009635d4123a3710bbb23ddbff3ac6d26d21bb6d", "cc7087f0a1f638f83e967af4e55d8dd5b04a3b42", "cf82d5ea05650560dd5066753ff02710adcba842", "d5f966d3156b665309cc177b24083a430819ed53", "0bd56311295454eda8e6b9804c71b86f20220a8c"], "outCitations": ["a3560a0f01cd8c4c82e44ba224fa2786db8d1d04", "76fc26939d73c565431e1f38107a4245e739284e", "13d4c2f76a7c1a4d0a71204e1d5d263a3f5a7986", "204baafe1e0d96c8c40198db4872804c01161944", "8010e480ad33f6f95e80f7361ba8928f07f80a13", "d8861f4b51508aca5c1a34467c60719c80f67053", "221f823d5f0335dfc640cb745c40840e14afd514", "b6fd785dcb2c2e84bfcdc49015dcd1100af273d2", "1d41d6ec4805f80b84a1ccd17f6753ba71e107f7", "6d8c9fcce8177d6f8d122d653c7d32d7624d6714", "004dda598893d576cc9ebfb5839db226a34989e1", "9642b527406b4e4456ff97e61cf829a5d930a497", "a00f99a5c270aafe330b7263405f94f0b3f2e280"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/13eb37839de2bff362d5da1fc3838be09f04d9f8", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1819/2194", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1819/2194/", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1819", "https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10289/4561/fast%20conditional.pdf;jsessionid=C586EDA4E1D92CBED5F21D8528A1117D?sequence=2"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "3", "journalPages": "1268-1273", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1507404272", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Pushing the boundaries of concurrency and parallelism, programmers are maximizing performance demanded by stakeholders. However, multi-threaded programs are challenging to test and debug. Prone to their own set of unique faults, such as race conditions, testers need to turn to automated validation tools for assistance. This paper's main contribution is a new algorithm called multi-stage novelty filtering (MSNF) that can aid in the discovery of software faults. MSNF stresses minimal configuration, no domain specific data preprocessing or software metrics. The MSNF approach is based on a multi-layered support vector machine scheme. After experimentation with the MSNF algorithm, we observed promising results in terms of precision. However, MSNF relies on multiple iterations (i.e., stages). Here, we propose four different strategies for estimating the number of the requested stages.", "authors": [{"name": "John  Cuzzola", "ids": ["1868746"]}, {"name": "Dragan  Gasevic", "ids": ["65953975"]}, {"name": "Ebrahim  Bagheri", "ids": ["145632843"]}], "inCitations": ["944cbe0c44d5f9931ee730db46d53f1857d9223b"], "outCitations": ["69c0c1b3a71bd29a764dbaa53bb607d4963fb426", "a570d48422c04bdd53875fe0688612d6e9328b8c", "5841a57970e7f9b70601a7c5d39e1271567f5cf7", "9f905c4050131f82bcfb503a580cfcfdedc25fc9", "4f656cf8b6f9f82ba9c2aa0ec918513acd8f04cb", "22f6f3f413f7eb4935c0c474fed4716fddd47da1", "b0bbea300988928b7c2998e98e52670b2c365327", "18c8c66e14d5276e5435376d67b9c9d16d7b58b7", "65955753512807715b8dc28dad2008624aa8ebea", "2795de171828e2bcfbd6226cfa9ecde6cf014c58", "3be442a936bff9325fa345c1be7c2d1e6199d3e5", "a46e1952b83dab52af8251182780bce2b0cb479e", "52b7bf3ba59b31f362aa07f957f1543a29a4279e", "273dfbcb68080251f5e9ff38b4413d7bd84b10a1", "a609d2dea3e97ab294c2930df699242bee141a2f", "c75298f217b32ea95742a7e5c1ba526ec15a969a"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3cc37b1a23601013eebf2b3c7d969b083d776fd7", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://ebagheri.athabascau.ca/papers/icmla11.pdf", "http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2011.69", "https://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~bagheri/papers/icmla11.pdf"], "venue": "2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops", "journalName": "2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops", "journalVolume": "1", "journalPages": "217-222", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2011.69", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2011.69", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2046760913", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

We use a wrapper-based attribute ranking technique to select a subset of attributes, and the random undersampling technique (RUS) on the majority class to alleviate the negative effects of imbalanced data on the prediction models. The datasets used in the empirical study were collected from numerous software projects. Five data preprocessing scenarios were explored in these experiments, including: (1) training on the original, unaltered fit dataset, (2) training on a sampled version of the fit dataset, (3) training on an unsampled version of the fit dataset using only the attributes chosen by feature selection based on the unsampled fit dataset, (4) training on an unsampled version of the fit dataset using only the attributes chosen by feature selection based on a sampled version of the fit dataset, and (5) training on a sampled version of the fit dataset using only the attributes chosen by feature selection based on the sampled version of the fit dataset. We compared the performances of the classification models constructed over these five different scenarios. The results demonstrate that the classification models constructed on the sampled fit data with or without feature selection (case 2 and case 5) significantly outperformed the classification models built with the other cases (unsampled fit data). Moreover, the two scenarios using sampled data (case 2 and case 5) showed very similar performances, but the subset of attributes (case 5) is only around 15% or 30% of the complete set of attributes (case 2).", "authors": [{"name": "Taghi M.

For a popular product, there are a large number of reviews. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to make an informed decision on purchasing the product, as well as for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. In this paper, we pay attention to online hotel reviews, and propose a supervised machine learning approach using unigram feature with two types of information (frequency and TF-IDF) to realize polarity classification of documents.

Based on linguistic observation on the opinion expression, some inner-and inter-sentence features are discovered. A multi-pass opinion retrieval system is then designed. Firstly, by using inner-sentence features, two base classifiers corresponding to opinion analysis and relevance estimation tasks, respectively, analyze the opinion and relevance of each sentence in the document. The inter-sentence features, including neighboring sentence-level, paragraph-level and document-level features, are obtained based on coarse analysis results. Secondly, both inner-sentence and inter-sentence features are incorporated the improved classifiers to refine the sentence analysis results and then update the inter-sentence features. Considering the strong association between opinionated sentences and topic-relevance sentences, the individual analysis results are refined following a mutual reinforcement mechanism. The updated features are then feed back to the improved classifier to further refine the sentence analysis results. Such circles terminate until the analysis results converge. Evaluations on NTCIR-7 MOAT dataset show that the proposed system achieved promising results. It shows that the proposed opinion retrieval system integrating coarse-fine analysis strategy and mutual reinforcement mechanism between opinion analysis and relevance estimation are effective.", "authors": [{"name": "Rui-Feng  Xu", "ids": ["3047401"]}, {"name": "Chun-Yu  Kit", "ids": ["3345087"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["28633b18c2b3bad80b1edb552146cc200b90f0e7", "5badb0d7e28d9a466ac35561ab7f7eab98f948b9", "ffd77cd376a8ba679e01300f0eb7518892701f62", "fa92940c811a41813297192c7a6cc834a0efe11f", "cf73c51ee5a0f76c68614c3040dc52f1a9a3757e", "7a2475703797fe51781ab43d10559f2bc306c796", "3f46b61a7216e5763ffab5d33e06b88c9d490c85", "12d0353ce8b41b7e5409e5a4a611110aee33c7bc", "1291d6e5b27c6688a7d66a97963b8f529d5de6ea", "ce20678cfbffded477f43df156f6ab37f6edc6a0", "cdcf7cb29f37ac0546961ea8a076075b9cc1f992", "167e1359943b96b9e92ee73db1df69a1f65d731d", "96f9e8ee890b4e142dd34dcf93fd52678eecd2b5", "672d709139fd78b07918655606df6e2bbf912b0e"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6312cf04011ec8b42f1dec3c072cec1454fd3cc5", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580678"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "6", "journalPages": "3347-3352", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580678", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580678", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2069871894", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Most tempo estimation systems focus mainly on detecting the temporal repetition and periodicity present within a signal, and represent tempo as a count of beats-per-minute (BPM). However, in real-world music retrieval applications such as music navigation and playlist generation, a rough perceptual representation of tempo may be more appropriate than a BPM representation. In this paper, the problem of tempo estimation is presented as a statistical classification problem. Four Perceptual Tempo Classes are defined which correspond to rough semantic terms that average users may use to describe tempo. Statistical models of each class are built using low-level audio features.

Here, we consider a cost function for pairwise clustering which maximizes model entropy under the constraint that the error for reconstructing objects from class information is fixed to a small value. Based on the analysis of structural transitions, we derive a new incremental pairwise clustering method which increases the number of clusters until a certain value of a Lagrange multiplier is reached. In addition, the calculation of phase transitions is used for speed-up. The incremental duplication of clusters helps to avoid local optima, and the stopping criterion automatically determines the number of clusters.

Previous work on multi-label learning assumes that for each instance, the \"full\" label set associated with each training instance is given by users. In many applications, however, to get the full label set for each instance is difficult and only a \"partial\" set of labels is available. In such cases, the appearance of a label means that the instance is associated with this label, while the absence of a label does not imply that this label is not proper for the instance. We call this kind of problem \"weak label\" problem. In this paper, we propose the WELL (WEak Label Learning) method to solve the weak label problem. We consider that the classification boundary for each label should go across low density regions, and that each label generally has much smaller number of positive examples than negative examples. The objective is formulated as a convex optimization problem which can be solved efficiently. Moreover, we exploit the correlation between labels by assuming that there is a group of low-rank base similarities, and the appropriate similarities between instances for different labels can be derived from these base similarities. Experiments validate the performance of WELL.", "authors": [{"name": "Yu-Yin  Sun", "ids": ["2354749"]}, {"name": "Yin  Zhang", "ids": ["1685889"]}, {"name": "Zhi-Hua  Zhou", "ids": ["145624000"]}],

RP is a potentially fatal side effect to treatment. Hence, new methods are needed to guide physicians to prescribe targeted therapy dosage to patients at high risk of RP. Several predictive models based on traditional statistical methods and machine learning techniques have been reported, however, no guidance to variation in performance has not been provided to date. Therefore, in this study, we compare several widely used classification algorithms in the machine learning field are used to distinguish between different risk groups of RP.

As a graph-based method for linear dimensionality reduction, Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) searches for an embedding space in which the similarity among the local neighborhoods is preserved. However, LPP has two disadvantages: Firstly, LPP doesn't take the label information into consideration which is crucial for classification tasks; Secondly, like most graph-based methods, graph construction of LPP is sensitive to noise and outliers. To these end, we propose an Enhanced Supervised LPP(ESLPP) that allows both locality and class label information to be incorporated which improves the performance of classification. In the mean time, ESLPP uses similarity based on robust path instead of Gaussian heat kernel similarity such that it can capture the underlying geometric distribution of samples even when there are noise and outliers. Experimental results on face databases confirm its effectiveness.", "authors": [{"name": "Xian-Fa  Cai", "ids": ["2534236"]}, {"name": "Guihua  Wen", "ids": ["9725901"]}, {"name": "Jia  Wei", "ids": ["145316287"]}, {"name": "Jie  Li", "ids": ["47786973"]}], "inCitations": ["d22b990d7d41a4455caf76c430e93eda3fd0a1c3", "b19f7727719d0b98196971e3a56db676232b8832", "308b0887c07a0853f544b777d50947d62585f650", "9a8220dff9005c3b7e802809beb36d5409bde56d", "266ee26a6115f1521ce374e4ab106d997c7b1407", "b3da05ac08e5f2775d9277014451ba566c633aa5", "111fd02983b4e974c12188dc4cfea84249701fd3", "c2fffbc7c82ebfde82e6dcb36231a3969e91ee1b", "150dc84a23685728941c5eb79b2f9f076f0984c1", "f2d37b76d91114e7b8a9b676d88d2337787c4dc5", "e42dd222a2cd510773bc3f0d7a6e51a978eba866", "69b2a7533e38c2c8c9a0891a728abb423ad2c7e7"], "outCitations": ["2a62d0cca2fabf1d6f6ee15e4c14cef415b657d1", "8459391dffcfdd6b83df45e69c02b0a0f32affe3", "3537fcd0ff99a3b3cb3d279012df826358420556", "bd6a23a868db96005f16f88baae0181c5047bca4", "75335244b49f4d1bb27aa51f1690bbefbbe1c3d1", "afcd6da7637ddeef6715109aca248da7a24b1c65", "b98cc2fe063031b2682d468d449666062f4e4c06", "be86da00efdd8c2a7fdeb2334605796c24b370f0", "bc3c2d97e967e18e1eafd9f2b1b887bf79c9d545", "1389d5e6de60baca6b5f2f6147d9f5f4b9fb2ef6"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d73fa30c78282962e7297c5a3e84a98cf790ec80", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6017017"], "venue": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "4", "journalPages": "1762-1766", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6017017", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6017017", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "magId": "2156028522", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

It is possible for data-based machine learning method to be employed for phenotype classification problem. But high dimensionality and small sample size make many machine learning methods fail. In this research, a PCA based sequential feature space learning method is proposed for gene selection. A two level feature selection process is conducted. In the first level PCA decomposition is conducted to obtain the orthogonal axis, and then features are projected and evaluated on the orthogonal axis. In second level, the features that have large projections are selected to form the feature space. Then the projections of all features onto the feature space are evaluated. Only features that have large projections both on orthogonal axis and feature subspace are selected as the feature subset. Then a neural network (NN) is employed to learn the classification model. The PCA based feature space learning is processed in a sequential manner until the classification performance is under pre-specified threshold and stable. The proposed methods have been applied to two gene microarray databases and showing good results.", "authors": [{"name": "Jinglin  Yang", "ids": ["94908005"]}, {"name": "Han-Xiong  Li", "ids": ["1702710"]}], "inCitations": ["9ada9b211cd11406a7d71707598b2a9466fcc8c9", "9e28966626ca15d7ef7cc15bc7af49256bba4b34", "2d112af3976eb5221adf6a7adeb2f7631678e738", "2de4437e88411baa9b324eb3fc6f3ec6d1f8e366", "26b1d6846f009bdb3671045321932b61f6c45694"], "outCitations": ["608ba959f3281276fb7d611002663d8ffebb60af", "bd0ef6c9b022bfb3e2fd5eac7a3547d6a4a7aa0e", "0051252657f1b7095ff6081988a8683dcf602860", "8407e02edbb92ade963e3150cb1886135c95966e", "9c2bec7994fe1cb65e8fa8c84ede0b3f5ab36149", "9a8d12f0c46d6995f79f59c812f0c09e5499bb40", "385197d4c02593e2823c71e4f90a0993b703620e", "a86171e13f84fe32212dd7fb6a1c31a34a47155f", "64d80c7c8c89c9f4b2d6652a5cd50fb124e308ca", "0e2811387136d9eda87536e6f68792743dd60f9e", "6e141ae9138956c1b16992f08ebd108e8dad9cc7", "bf5dd634310c3d14264d0483eb11e705c8bbb96a", "fe84db9e87a513b285ab32147cd901782e66616d", "522f7657d8f57ec179b1af3ecb9816ad803989f5", "818ae163e7cb4959b338919cb5162e2fdda02173", "3f600e6c6cf93e78c9e6e690443d6d22c4bf18b9", "24cd495a07b9502ad2b130a26cb29b81a9e9bc82", "1b37279dce5ca9606cbf62a1daf2cbc4dfecc339", "e897c3f740f2021bd800a9ec1ec4841f191432b6", "c57603bafa77ad51114157493c365dc889ea5e9c", "33bb073a4d2605e9c8417ee23182dc2c9c4c05ef", "34a22de85f86e1d3afa6b7242aa15b8e981cca21", "12b2d15902f54c058b2d09d0ad1fa7a0b6efb9bf", "c854cafd119a9e178be1c0a8bfbc684e1a0a9efe", "08b43d84e6747e370ef307e2ada50675b414514a", "fb6b4b57f431a0cfbb83bb2af8beab4ee694e94c", "34d405eaecab40a932108a7ff97e92fb8fd1ae4e", "5405e980bebaa64406eb1b8e278b70dfe42a9cb5", "26887a17ef00fc2a6b58d931b821c48d5160f4a1", "41c6f229c4b149d502f89ffc386febb24116bd25", "cf27aac6a0d29028dd5fd8504f22e194d84999b6", "6e436b11eab90258229643cd47861f430f00080c", "1dd4eddb97fdf91156215c95803d688488aebef4", "5794141889d0e994c3103b0aaab08a18222c9c43", "004888621a4e4cee56b6633338a89aa036cf5ae5", "21d738d2dd21ebef76db1f6a1bb1890d3f02c6e2", "5c5e795736703d9aa7147fedbb1d669ea5c989f0", "95b1ddb21d6a0b66176ac3a9489e6e352d4eb697"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7df7c2091dd0ac6323c96d8e25ffdf5cf57ab6cc", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580720"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "6", "journalPages": "3079-3084", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580720", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580720", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1985046575", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

In the calibration task, we demonstrate that a GA approach is able to find parameters that are equally good or better at minimizing error versus historical data, compared to a previous factorial grid-based approach. The GA approach also allows us to explore a wider range of parameters and parameter settings. Previous univariate sensitivity analysis on the Artificial Anasazi model did not consider potentially complex/nonlinear interactions between parameters. With the GA-based approach, we perform multivariate sensitivity analysis to discover how greatly the model can diverge from historical data, while the parameters are constrained within a close range of previously calibrated values. We show that by varying multiple parameters within a 10% range, the model can produce dramatically and qualitatively different results, and further demonstrate the utility of sensitivity analysis for model testing, by the discovery of a small coding error. Through this case study, we discuss some of the issues that can arise with calibration and sensitivity analysis of agent-based models.", "authors": [{"name": "Forrest  Stonedahl", "ids": ["1941583"]}, {"name": "Uri  Wilensky", "ids": ["144904732"]}], "inCitations": ["78dfa33d250fa3fcf725ed9c997cfb94d2224b84", "a6168ccc1f1438b57638d1a9d28a5e7423b7c08b", "3eb05eaf1e5cb2a7876a1bc0e1b81c7a3c8a9163", "3764ad19d3baec2e5bc10195894f4d5d6fd4711b", "6ba5f2adaf6d36d397e78ae6b4f013d883843214", "23f55ed5ecc069f46e791e12b0bedc114390b36c", "a6e897bebba825a79338d121a9c912ce8ee0b8f0", "0303031693e64c3fe2cb3829c5f93a26af1713b6", "6e4abe45f2981c8e0dc0cc2e2615f7b1bb1fcd68", "3bb1d0fd28094b9a6acd42a54c0a9bba8052ac24", "bdb65f712daf88151e06ff867bfb019a0e1fe99c", "af398f594155cf5968acb3b601cc96b7ea563248", "4042885146d095ace8680bc52c1836e615a9aac5", "88f666dea71f1da5ba948f77a80aef70e4f30617", "586ff7edc982b82619f36652b3200290457f44ba", "50e406bd4cded1b0488a275afa20ba64f1e5aadd", "304e5fc4a6b227c42d5c8d4a7ed0fcf56034dac8", "5b8e641c6e372d895cfa623da66a4947837fdf0e", "dc19aacbaaeed6a2b410bfad3f77f1fc2242be54", "ce56a8fab13c767ab03704bc7f084760b2b3ec69", "f4ddad85a0b809be8487bdcaae3ff7778956a224", "859037be7a0ce3a0afc5be29f7721c85122b61bd", "fa4a4da97c07d0ed26cfb01ed14da9a745eecdb2", "02c63458646e683b0eec537452fb2a27c7cb0db0", "c04bfd6c553a196edb5d88548d65cb3f615994b8", "0779b0f6ac69f17b53c9b99d477e70ad7e9c9bf0", "82271f290fa3464bcc776b9a2cc4c837afc0fcee", "aa54b9f6aa45c92681063974cc12ec8ffd568410", "fd1a31f2e3a5eacdc3f3004e02e8c588103d396a", "a51c03e8387f5b19734354c2ac2d4c39c8dc9526"], "outCitations": ["6de07663705ec1e89f29b799e35de0b38f248ffd", "12029240f3c3b34f6ef29e72039b0491cf73f0e2", "f90d6dca4e10c6afebe8f0678c08e7380e57d09a", "e40c868f8e8792cfc397b61d076b10c4f3bd7465", "6c6127f2dd02a4e8c1e70a848bcfd1dea370078c", "542527c29a81586a0a8e90643a075116c85933cc", "bc95e73248b5733c6ee2491b4e1b78eadc4120e1", "4b4279db68b16e20fbc56f9d41980a950191d30a", "93e6ff2d30f810d14e83e387535a63b9688d5a6d", "ccf00ac1209a4595daf2e92ea58d80d3be8289ff", "e09e25eb5d3489bfc72e31ffe1c5a30e498117c6", "cdb27ae8324d991eeb0568b1b9cfc2a89c5fc11f", "04b11f4733990597c648d3a8c7d6a51c8bdb5313", "e1468b56635d4ddcebd919d99fe432301af601d7", "bfed3e0ebc55f33f489f57cafdbd4fa14460461d", "eda06dec5f9e9b85e6938bc2edc21048f26790d8", "f147e971602de6a0183483d6ac47b908baa55dcf", "ee7c58ace79810eabd34f147da9466bf59807b9c", "dc27df46ef94ff5aeb96140720a61d31927e2afd", "d29688be6ad3b20a89233ce0cf291bbbf3e394c9", "135068fcdf305ab11edf6cdd0687264286f56e38", "389044111af026df4ab8ac39a687a7bfdc62556a", "5f1ec18cdb98fedb157539ba8d0948259df72570", "3eec87a1c5edd75160d4ea5827e050e240efb047", "78ac3350da6676a083db88c4ddbe88e1ee1380a0", "8f0887b62cad65e60e9ee1eb46fb3377b3f324d7", "5627b6deb8cd38f718ae47207f6c3b8ccf559399", "649915bd6da1a465e069f47499d7b55c26a6b4ea"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ba869808056bdb37c6920ddb197bf39b231bf197", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://ccl.northwestern.edu/papers/2010/Stonedahl2010Anasazi.pdf", "http://ccl.northwestern.edu/2010/Stonedahl%20and%20Wilensky.pdf", "http://ccl.northwestern.edu/papers/2010/Stonedahl%20and%20Wilensky.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FSS/FSS10/paper/view/2181", "http://ccl.sesp.northwestern.edu/papers/2010/Stonedahl2010Anasazi.pdf", "http://ccl.sesp.northwestern.edu/papers/2010/Stonedahl%20and%20Wilensky.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI Fall Symposium: Complex Adaptive Systems", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "120-129", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2242389164", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Current efforts designing unmanned aircraft for in situ sensing are described as well as future architectures for embedded reasoning by autonomous systems within complex atmospheric phenomena.", "authors": [{"name": "Eric W.

In planning, for example, state-space search has in the last several years been preferred to logic-based methods such as SAT. In our recent work, we have demonstrated that the observed performance differences between SAT and specialized state-space search methods largely go back to the difference between a blind (or at least planning-agnostic) and a planning-specific search method.

This method is based on applying different image transforms to the distinct parts of a facial image according to the lighting direction and illumination intensity.

It has been mentioned that a combined use of good and bad seeds can lead to better results. However, little work has been known to realize this insight successfully. A serious issue of existing algorithms is that trust/distrust is propagated in non-differential ways. However, it seems to be impossible to implement differential propagation if only trust or distrust is propagated. In this paper, we view that each Web page has both a trustworthy side and an untrustworthy side, and assign two scores to each Web page: T-Rank, scoring the trustworthiness, and D-Rank, scoring the untrustworthiness. We then propose an integrated framework which propagates both trust and distrust. In the framework, the propagation of T-Rank/D-Rank is penalized by the target's current D-Rank/T-Rank. In this way, propagating both trust and distrust with target differentiation is implemented. The proposed Trust-Distrust Rank (TDR) algorithm not only makes full use of both good seeds and bad seeds, but also overcomes the disadvantages of both existing trust propagation and distrust propagation algorithms. Experimental results show that TDR outperforms other typical anti-spam algorithms under various criteria.", "authors": [{"name": "Xianchao  Zhang", "ids": ["2178836"]}, {"name": "You  Wang", "ids": ["97594827"]}, {"name": "Nan  Mou", "ids": ["2026164"]}, {"name": "Wenxin  Liang", "ids": ["3286243"]}], "inCitations": ["8177391d9fda6ec1215534eab9bc876352cec0a7", "e82199bc02f26dcb23ea087c578822c70284ed9f", "c4c24ddddee730bde67d6f21a7f25c1580546df7", "cb5532fbe4b93a6ee387425222a9639ba5210a88", "aa6f02e843ba0397413f77f460be14a295750bd2", "c3618b6abe96abdf8b4159e08be1259b788b8be2", "5a06db8d623fa942749b2fadf5aeac468c09b440", "9e4f2b0f32a95ad31f1dfb9c8eca2cfcc3e02a48", "24b111296fffc50f8795b5ea451f3a85a1df2005", "be6b5c9cad3b936f398b4ff75d5e3b6875b986d0", "9e47e5c6db09734568ce09d168c948d16c01122c", "a90a544693077b63b88f84a618b71867b2187e63", "52273e333a4730e636380d839037cf222854d581", "894a85fcf7b8e0f74036b503bbe8bd156b7ca5b7", "165cfe06ae807572478aa37ecd3d58cc4c0160c2", "5a5deddc95f3950df76858778246b91af1d8e49b", "c0f729bcce72d319aaec2987a0d4b6e3b0a1c6e2", "c7161a1d51c75980126c08283715617a57997bb8"], "outCitations": ["b658d2033f70ff2ddbbe55b13cf3df24436d6e87", "25d2084ca188819e1c716383fa4a1a9b19c1fc4f", "82db87e2fd08e80b59d98a6f4b21b28898393fcd", "6052dfcd0ef886e4c7a43e01c3e0cc77366a0b9e", "38612e346fdf3158c32c16058f7e8820a8f0325e", "50228e238413e47c05ea18342a3c8db24be50b0c", "10d6778bc45aebcd58d336b4062b935861d2fe8a", "e4141b21e3e0d8d1925f448274ee81b7d6efab5e", "46dcba93715fb8246c6d7aee96c9fba00fa902a8", "14fbd8613defd10e3a08bb04dfcea02aae0e1c8b", "5411b5add7dd4350036378206d227034881e6a8d", "302cbbd18cb6aa7da7668ba345a55cf2c9e426d4"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/052d941a0b69a990f8ac78f00293815ca900033c", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/view/3600", "http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~nelkadri/CSI5389/Papers/192-Zhang_et_al_AAAI2011.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/download/3600/4066"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1292-1297", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "198314969", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

It is used in many fields including machine learning, data mining, customer segmentation, trend analysis, pattern recognition and image analysis. The proposed Localized Diffusion Folders methodology performs hierarchical clustering of high-dimensional datasets. The diffusion folders are multi-level data partitioning into local neighborhoods that are generated by several random selections of data points and folders in a diffusion graph and by defining local diffusion distances between them. This multi-level partitioning defines an improved localized geometry of the data and a localized Markov transition matrix that is used for the next time step in the diffusion process. The result of this clustering method is a bottom-up hierarchical clustering of the data while each level in the hierarchy contains localized diffusion folders of folders from the lower levels.

For example, in 2009, the delay of the monsoon rains by a month in India affected several macroeconomic factors including food price increases, a stock market slump, agricultural product export restrictions, and an array of agricultural subsidies. Over the past decade, there has been a growing trend in the number of farmer suicide deaths throughout the country due to a combination of economic, social, and environmental factors. On one hand, the fraction of arable land has decreased over the years due to soil erosion factors, excessive use of pesticides, and land encroachment from urban dwellers (buying land in rural areas). On the other hand, agriculture as an occupation has become less profitable due to a combination of poor yield (due to poor water availability, monsoon unpredictability, and soil erosion) and an increase in the cost of living. Many of these factors hint at a pending agrarian catastrophe. From a technology perspective, what can we do to help agrarian communities in India and elsewhere?

To cope with such a data deluge, manifold models are often developed that provide a powerful theoretical and algorithmic framework for capturing the intrinsic structure of data governed by a low-dimensional set of parameters. However, these models do not typically take into account dependencies among multiple sensors. We thus propose a new joint manifold framework for data ensembles that exploits such dependencies. We show that joint manifold structure can lead to improved performance for manifold learning.

Ranking SVM (RSVM) is a typical method of learning to rank. But this approach is time consuming, which decreases its applicability in real-world IR applications, which involves a large amount of computation, because it requires increasing the complexity from n to O(n2). This paper analyzes the characteristics of the partial order on instance pairs. We point out and prove that there is a transitive characteristic in this kind partial order data. An improved loss function is proposed based on the transitivity, which reduces the complexity greatly. Also we give the bound of the complexity of the improved RSVM, from which we can see that the actual complexity is usually near the lower bound in real-world application.

These web services always are owned by different companies and organizations, and are geographically distributed. How to compose these web services together to fulfill a business process is usually a challenge issue. Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is a problem solving paradigm. It uses successful experiences in past to solve similar problems at present or/and in the future. In this paper, a set of approaches to support web service composition based on CBR is presented for case retrieval.

This can be seen as an enormous repository of information which brings significant business value for companies working in e-commerce activities. However, the main problems encountered when using this information are: (I) the information is published in various, non-machine-processable formats, (II) a lack of services that match and store information from various sources in a homogenous structure, and (III) the accessible datasets are rarely provided with e-commerce concepts in mind. These problems make them difficult to use by e-commerce applications. The main goal of this paper is to propose a methodology and analysis of components required for combining and integrating information into machine-processable dataset from different Web data sources, based on suitable e-commerce ontology.

Meanwhile, a tree-like hierarchical structure is well-suited for organizing the retrieved results in favor of web users. In this regard, we introduce a new method for hierarchical clustering of web snippets by exploiting a phrase-based document index. In our method, a hierarchy of web snippets is built based on phrases instead of all snippets, and the snippets are then assigned to the corresponding clusters consisting of phrases. We show that, as opposed to the traditional hierarchical clustering, our method not only presents meaningful cluster labels but also improves clustering performance.", "authors": [{"name": "Zhao  Li", "ids": ["144695970"]}, {"name": "Xindong  Wu", "ids": ["1748808"]}], "inCitations": ["f96f48599e44b3494b808949f356fc5f3aee50f8", "9f97f25aa7bb32c120f9950a401c6898a04f0ac9", "c449a45ecd85786dd799a7c99f3d79d2261c6d50", "e427b083a38a8e9f163abef14b51b643ebd00327", "a7be0b8fb0bb0a5ab397002541a5edcee524a298", "f7f9bd3964c8584160f57af5a7e4ee07210fa3ea"], "outCitations": ["86697d3a3b461f17a399308ed444b79367345380", "58ba55263d6e85018517c9545ce4b2d8c216dad7", "aeb4d3e0ed9799136cf5c5011540a6ed8d23b287", "320bdc47fc1e8682308d2008f25dbc2939d0a892"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/69332feacee15669ff15fd22fcc46212cb607d30", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1612/2313", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1612"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1947-1948", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1590884926", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

First, we propose a new fuzzy ranking method based on the \u03b1-cuts of generalized fuzzy numbers and interval type-2 fuzzy sets. The proposed fuzzy ranking method involves a decision-maker's attitude towards risks to calculate the left areas and the right areas of generalized fuzzy numbers and interval type-2 fuzzy sets with the consideration of the heights of generalized fuzzy numbers and interval type-2 fuzzy sets. Based on the proposed fuzzy ranking method, we propose a new method for fuzzy decision making. The proposed fuzzy decision making method is more flexible and more intelligent than the existing fuzzy decision making methods, where it not only considers the decision-maker's attitude towards risks, but also can deal with situations where the evaluating values are represented by interval type-2 fuzzy sets.", "authors": [{"name": "Shyi-Ming  Chen", "ids": ["1686547"]}, {"name": "Cheng-Yi  Wang", "ids": ["1702301"]}], "inCitations": ["d6efe3afc81a941c92b72319bcdf77a127b2ea68", "949d801effaed1ae06adf71bbd4e2731c66b5a0c", "564c9a1bc6c37e979a6d00a773b3de74f959c383", "fdcdcdc793c885e8c111f0e4067893b8aaa5341d", "a397e32ee434883ed9c532d55cb0edbf5f2bad83"], "outCitations": ["edab76e9523f13d48d3311a282a5bca41f45acfd", "36078d42275d5cba89e64473e43b434532d3a8f8", "893a81a9ae956291a30716754a6e3ae0d52c5b5a", "831857ecd4cc486afbcc3c30b8eb7d0214dc3c5a", "4716e27e884c3a1c748d93ff00240b7c1b68cb7d", "e518a93e6dfe45b4b5758bd433e93ede94d1b60b", "e8f4c7477e95001efa4df08839495b0a4fc2b814", "7d8e5961b1a39598483ee8e7d1bcb18d3a778ab7", "6b5144d6b7dd41b4d5c61d12b5d045f75713e24c", "2bf2166b0d469e7738491b2ce463989796fc102b", "13a4612c7adb828b02f9457a16a5fd9fb6e113f9", "d5c93fe44d9564fe5059a1ba30797bcd4ddf459a", "1babf7819695e779f5911885e83fc1f02404028f", "543dd6fb3875be1c1a5a7c5b36cb4248730e821f"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/998435e9415f956902c7c57c5f30075e51955357", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016693"], "venue": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "1", "journalPages": "131-136", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016693", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016693", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "magId": "2103947933", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

{"id": "1937ed14ea312053f0c948f20b35915a4dc6bba7", "title": "An access-context based method to detect network scanning event in LAN", "text": "Usually there are leading DNS resolution operations in normal network access scenarios and at the same time the relative connection success ratio is very high; but there is no leading DNS resolution operation in network scanning scenarios and the relative connection success ratio is very low. For convenience in this paper we named the network access connection attempt without leading DNS resolution operation as Suspicious Network Access (SNA). A network scanning detection approach is proposed in this paper by the analysis of SNAs' response ratio and the randomness of their target IP addresses for each host in LAN. Since the proposed approach only takes the SNAs into account and the interference from normal network access can be decreased effectively, it can detect network scanning attacks with high accuracy and efficiency. The experiment results in simulation network scenario showed that the proposed approach support the detection of TCP-SYN and ICMP type network scanning attacks and also support the detection of stealth network scanning attacks as well.", "authors": [{"name": "Di  Wu", "ids": ["144953179"]}, {"name": "Ping  Yin", "ids": ["47602747"]}, {"name": "Xiao-Hua  Chen", "ids": ["49794428"]}, {"name": "Ning  Bu", "ids": ["50522554"]}], "inCitations": ["fc8db0170e54462fc9c04eec434ef105a7aae219"], "outCitations": ["d53323f86f5aa8894c95a851c7658208f4fb8b68", "bec5fb628a25ae3837cc88f99c677cbf46f9176c", "440b296d3a360bdb6cddaa6802b33d28d235633d", "5e5cc9b83ea55da2aa579199cfe2133cfe834a46", "1d85e03bb45eeef288f30b6daba802038a4cce92"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1937ed14ea312053f0c948f20b35915a4dc6bba7", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "5", "journalPages": "2781-2786", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212650", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212650", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2061576143", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

The shepherding problem has many important and practical applications in security, environmental protection, agriculture, education and more. While much research has focused on simulating coordinated group behaviors, the shepherding problem has not received as much attention as it should be. This work investigate the possibility of addressing the shepherding problem using motion planning strategies. From an algorithmic point of view, the shepherding problem is extremely challenging due to its extremely large state space. It is clear that the existing motion planning methods cannot provide an efficient way to solve the problem. Instead, we propose an approach that incorporates computer-human interaction techniques with algorithmic robotics: an interactive motion planning method. In our experimental results, we have shown that this combination indeed provides performance improvement over the human-only and the computeronly approach. Although the proposed work shows promising initial results from our first prototype system, there are still a long way to go before we can have a better understanding of the interactive method for motion planning and the shepherd-", "authors": [{"name": "Jyh-Ming  Lien", "ids": ["1693715"]}, {"name": "Emlyn  Pratt", "ids": ["48996961"]}], "inCitations": ["796f30a9fa3d083e5bb3faa0fd1a9c6fb91bc5da", "c3078b5caa1ec9c8129a9b37dc21bc5a07de5858", "95ca02ab178a54381b66f9b6ad9a6710dea456ea", "4d7cdc99fdb16d3cbfe3382cfd686a86965c79eb", "b6f3fef2c85f7bc2d4619e166d2626887825da62", "1e8fdd893e23077e9df9f3504efd0bff30557e01", "e24312464e436c93cfa10bceff73b6c4e90192f4", "3a53bcd46e41df3537bb17178f57db53857c1ccd", "174f92c67bd98c5dc5cf32e7cb16dcf780c2f420", "59ca5dcd83d75fe3937fbd75874a6d8ffe1d89c5", "dad2d6e5c9cd590ba76e38a04cb80ee7631b2370", "12be1f3a785e200b8e4a6c4038c82d9690d4c8e0", "af67d50dfb4e0a09cbf41b23d2f7773070f6a050", "97a9fc5ae6c0452181027fde66102579f1e50b4b"], "outCitations": ["12464ca4ec3da07ab247de9439759580b9866bf3", "9e1132ca09359dabce459cde3a8a036b74b47b4e", "cf3e1b5311c3bf8edcfff31b1e55d36c8a494321", "77c19ed7057d0fbd842d8c63d79a730c8e576d9f", "0800357049444fb80588f264d68e0c23f9b12a19", "8578b61d6d619e19962889ab8adf5a1dd0946793", "e792e69c300c6bce06b08f239b1c9db9a068c7e7", "e51156ebcf273cdb3939203a32a93bda52a96340", "4eb04dbe56574bcc2d80820098d36d6f69dc6978", "81c04a57340a9ba04b0b82b22a4419f3dca98699", "891b8d457218cf6d81b49d328c1a2be5608b123c", "18c6d1eb484b927f61f0da84adecf2dcf7d1b187", "69b70fbdb7f26d3ef0a9cc05677b9f3b9031796d", "e10cabac2e5e90dafd9ccea24578bf0cd3f987d0", "82b5795f581808a9fde23e052495cc05c986556e", "f487bc30949a39db7741be99cc1119448709c99c", "38a614cad1a965c7186bf5a8d9322f669fb22aa2", "874b0fc3bf19f08a2fe41965118ab89da1782af3", "a8f7686ea8abc7c7a8cc8358880a71da0d7a0dc2", "46415ffcda99e01bae0e102bb5a267282180b48f", "0ac5be7da44e2fbe99f44b0cbf0264793c305ed8", "3c68254561626bf86aeacb592dc18845b8f89254", "e87c3d2ae2a677043ff72a56fa1ec2bf38e586c0", "b330572d54827974902eea7a054b226ef49095d4", "c9a70a972d003fc31b40e703f024e932185537ff", "87c268f9d2fe29c4912bcaa233a6815ec15b46da", "48abac03ec49c5bb10d4a8840cf77390916f7085", "0e403ff1698c501cd9d8b9f395e619cdb9768ee4", "dad989e8074970ddb5e501a40623eba58baea4ce", "06952e2450d82764d0da4b641f60fcfa4cf333c6", "f5a6bd19e2331e0a9b83cd105e5d697e35b0762e", "c0bae12edbd94e4e4d722c51e2df750491b409ee", "9b3123df69bcc0405a7a01729c8087ec466ff44e", "64e0133b835abf4d6baccce68de77358a30ecf4e"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/85dac51df49d16707543f8d346226470e35eb56a", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://cs.gmu.edu/~jmlien/masc/uploads/Main/aaaiss09.pdf", "http://masc.cs.gmu.edu/wiki/uploads/InteractiveShepherding/aaaiss09.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Spring/2009/SS-09-01/SS09-01-014.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Spring/2009/ss09-01-014.php"], "venue": "AAAI Spring Symposium: Agents that Learn from Human Teachers", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "95-102", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2406612398", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

An appropriate distance metric in the data space is quite demanding for a great number of applications. In this paper, we pose robust and tractable metric learning under pairwise constraints that are expressed as similarity judgements between data pairs. The major features of our approach include: 1) it maximizes the gap between the average squared distance among dissimilar pairs and the average squared distance among similar pairs; 2) it is capable of propagating similar constraints to all data pairs; and 3) it is easy to implement in contrast to the existing approaches using expensive optimization such as semidefinite programming. Our constrained metric learning approach has widespread applicability without being limited to particular backgrounds. Quantitative experiments are performed for classification and retrieval tasks, uncovering the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "authors": [{"name": "Wei  Liu", "ids": ["46641573"]}, {"name": "Xinmei  Tian", "ids": ["40434674"]}, {"name": "Dacheng  Tao", "ids": ["143719920"]}, {"name": "Jianzhuang  Liu", "ids": ["7137861"]}], "inCitations": ["d8d013d370fddcb5bd1288d43bbaa510d4e3a335", "ee58f4651fce3ff804fee472229259e0902f1b40", "f49dfb1e88297f993c57bad946dfac4f1cae13df", "dfa5a0cce66f9e840dd98ac8094434efcc4a9de5", "8435287aa7ef5eb92c97fdad798612de1fa11453", "4b76fea1eb908b24f541999cf85c860ae9993fb7", "00cfcfc365dbbe30bfbee6b4f04d068a539a7d97", "a4754372ff977ad65b1eac7148fddd442ad6dc9c", "f9580e84936439c20ecebf429765c819afba7070", "5f10ea87566acd3f0cff0c73a402900c02c9378a", "d48658bc4fdfd2d686b4c2197d0575fd1f8b097f", "8932489ecb5a921090c72ee2572105732d2c882e", "97eb15c41ae3512ea096805ddb4d168bd51e7919", "ed5331c59352287ede4464ba482af376821f9c9b", "5966ee80c468f8285089cf33d12c3225ff098cb3", "f85a2829467251ed15062db8a302a39386d020ee", "3719cb71298d6ea4bb35ef4530291481eba28dc9", "3fe24ff597066cbef5ee3aefccd4bab61187b506", "7d77f2a1e5374ff9b8230522b0848a5d54b7fb14", "b44165f5340b14bbba16ac6384f53fd8081541b0", "80c20ac9dc3508adec95c2093a95ae2fd27c8e32", "c3743985cbf2dd15b424a7c4157ab6d6093a29e1", "3215f816a49566a099c9467666b0601659fe295f", "c87a8ef00066f5198b55e58a79aff66cdee345b8", "0ff898bd960645fd52f7e374b20eccb4f1f7c9fd", "b95fda3c9e9f0badfd00e7e4da143dc4574aea50", "17a58a503df9bb1b7b582e1053b356d4c41c04fb"], "outCitations": ["d1f66ecdb910b103659f464cb39a0146789d99f8", "861839d67bacd1d2e5a956a172dddc8644e634fb", "78947497cbbffc691aac3f590d972130259af9ce", "a2db62b059f2c314094e1ed4e11f5f565dc64b1d", "85ca6bf1968fe41603a0c08e097220652654c04e", "b81381d17baf6750c09bd58e96f4660d25be9225", "686ac5ea550e8b73c98c988c420c41a7833ca844", "24c287d97982216c8f35c8d326dc2ec2d2475f3e", "e45a3ec008d2a9c4b815ceaa15783c9e3ccf6e6f", "5176a2f31dace77db9135dde7020d2c37f78cca0", "f7c8805d5ff6b07181d70995db5aaa866c3c670d", "75335244b49f4d1bb27aa51f1690bbefbbe1c3d1", "afcd6da7637ddeef6715109aca248da7a24b1c65", "ecadeb93378d7911c2f7b9bd83a8af55d7fa9e06", "0b7c4096ed697696a5f4fc8f3a6a750dc0cdecfe", "da45f7b87b1c3c8d0b8d1284ccd7665e729e36b8", "4f607f03272e4d62708f5b2441355f9e005cb452", "d1a2d203733208deda7427c8e20318334193d9d7", "0bacca0993a3f51649a6bb8dbb093fc8d8481ad4", "93f61088195d97dd3cce9ead6ed6cba2d547f138", "3537fcd0ff99a3b3cb3d279012df826358420556"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e643f45b5073d064d00435833fa476bfdcbbfce3", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~wliu/AAAI10_metric.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1950", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1950/2029"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "518-524", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1572368544", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

{"id": "5dcc3e89df1550fab56a40cb05e38c42e1e5f18f", "title": "Privacy in Online Social Lending", "text": "Online social lending is the Web 2.0\u2019s response to classical bank loans. Borrowers publish credit applications on websites which match them with private investors. We point to a conflict between economic interests and privacy goals in online social lending, empirically analyze the effect of data disclosure on credit conditions, and outline directions towards efficient yet privacy-friendly alternative credit markets. \u201cThere is no practice more dangerous than that of borrowing money,\u201d said George Washington in 1797. For sure he has not accounted for the privacy risks of 21 century online social lending, the topic of this paper. Online social lending, also known as peer-to-peer lending, has grown rapidly after the launch of the first commercial platform, UK-based Zopa.com, in 2005. Drawing on concepts of (offline) micro-finance, the idea of social lending is to provide a marketplace for unsecured personal loans: an online platform lets borrowers advertise credit projects to individual lenders, who decide in which project they invest. Credit risk is shared in project-specific pools of lenders; each member funds a small share of the financed amount. As compensation for taking risk, interest is paid to the lenders, whereas platform operators typically charge fixed (i. e., riskfree) fees. The exact market mechanism differs between platforms and has very recently been subject to research in mechanism design (Chen, Ghosh, and Lambert 2009). Independent of the specific mechanism, matching borrowers\u2019 demand with lenders\u2019 supply online sidesteps the traditional role of banks as intermediaries in credit markets. Obviously, this technology-driven paradigm shift in organizing credit markets has a string of economic and social consequences. This paper covers only a small part, namely the role of personal data and the impact of social lending on borrowers\u2019 informational privacy. Borrowers\u2019 privacy is affected since credit applications entail personal data being irrevocably disclosed on the Internet. We will briefly revisit the role of information in credit markets from a privacy protection point of view and contrast it with empirical results from data collected on Smava.de, the largest German social lending platform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to study social lending from a privacy angle. AAAI Spring Symposium on Intelligent Information Privacy Management, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, March 2010 Background and Research Question Adequate and coherent privacy regulation requires deep understanding of how the distribution of personal data (i. e., knowledge about individuals\u2019 attributes) in a society affects social welfare. It is unlikely that in the near future, a single unified model will be ripe enough to guide policy makers. Therefore it is advisable to break the large problem into smaller, more tractable sector-specific ones. Credit markets form a particularly relevant sector for at least three reasons: first, they are core to modern economies\u2019 allocation of capital; second, credit markets are driven by information and thus exhibit a clear link to questions of privacy regulation; and third, advances in technology are about to change the shape of credit markets substantially, as witnessed by the uptake of online social lending over the past couple of years. A welcome side-aspect is the availability of empirical data. Personal Information in Credit Markets Aside from traditional functions of financial intermediaries in credit markets, such as size, risk, and maturity transformation, modern economic theory recognizes that information is crucial to prevent market failure (Stiglitz 1981). At the same time, useful information almost always consists of personal data of borrowers. While privacy activists were already concerned about the use of such information by hopefully trustworthy institutions, such as banks and credit bureaus (Jentsch 2007), the privacy problem exacerbates when credit-relevant personal data is disclosed to every potential lender. For current platforms, this means all Internet users. Borrowers\u2019 personal data may influence lenders\u2019 credit decisions by several mechanisms: \u2022 Most importantly, information asymmetries (Akerlof 1970) preclude lenders from distinguishing between good and bad risks. Detailed information on borrowers and their envisaged projects helps to assess the likelihood of timely debt service and to adjust credit conditions accordingly. This improves the overall allocation of capital. \u2022 Knowing personal details of creditors, including their identity, facilitates contract monitoring and legal recourse in case of default. The mere possibility to do so can prevent moral hazard over the payback period. \u2022 This feedback channel exists also indirectly through joint liability and social sanctions (Besley and Coate 1995). Debt service is encouraged by pressure from the borrower\u2019s close social network (e. g., family, community) whose reputation is at risk in the case of default. These mechanisms require the disclosure of personal data of the borrower\u2019s peers. A borrower\u2019s decision to seek credit thus affects the privacy of others, too. \u2022 One has to consider behavioral effects as well: trust between market participants can be established by communicating personal attributes as social cues (Kolm 2000). \u2022 Borrowers may use persuasion techniques to convince potential lenders of their credit projects with rational (consistency, plausibility) or emotional arguments (helping tendency, altruism, goodness). Such arguments often tell a lot about the borrower and thus contain personal data. This list is most likely incomplete, but good enough to point out that online social lending exhibits an outright conflict between economic goals and privacy protection goals. This calls for research in at least two directions: first, to study how people deal with the conflict, and second, can we find technical, organizational, or legal provisions to alleviate it? Related Work on Online Social Lending Online social lending has recently attracted interest of scholars in economics and social sciences. Unless otherwise stated, all prior art is based on data of Prosper.com, the major online social lending platform serving US residents. Ravina (2007) as well as Pope and Syndor (2008) look at discrimination in credits decisions made on social lending platforms. They report effects of race, age, gender, and weight on credit conditions, though not always statistically significant. Credit conditions were operationalized by (inverse) interest rate, or the probability of (full) funding success. The predictors were either extracted from categorial data of the project description, or manually assigned by evaluating text or pictures. A study by Herzenstein et al. (2008) comes one step closer to privacy aspects. The authors measured the level of detail of the project description on a 3-step ordinal scale and found it to be a major influencing factor for funding success after controlling for fundamental financial parameters, such as amount, starting interest rate in an auction market, and the (endogenous) duration of the listing. In terms of predictive power, the researchers distinguished between demographic factors (e. g., gender), financial factors (e. g., credit score), and effort measures (e. g., length of project description). The first category was found to have only very little effect on funding success, whereas the latter two categories were found to be decisive. Another string of research has focused on social network theory and tries to identify decision pattern and peerinfluence within the social network of registered users of a social lending platform. An early study found that endorsement by group leaders\u2014typically lenders\u2014has the most positive effect on both funding success and total number of bids (Ryan, Reuk, and Wang 2007). This indicates that in social lending, a personal recommendation can be more important than \u2018hard\u2019 facts, such as credit scores. This finding was confirmed by Berger and Gleisner, who analyzed the role of group leaders as new \u201cfinancial intermediaries\u201d (Berger and Gleisner 2009). Freedman and Jin (2008) as well as HerreroLopez (2009) studied whether the social network between borrowers can contribute to reducing information asymmetries and thus is helpful to make good investments. They report empirical evidence that a borrower\u2019s affiliation with a reputed group increases the chance of full funding and results in lower interest rates. When looking at the realized default rates, however, the picture becomes more complicated: according to a study by Everett (2008), mere group membership tends to increase default rates. Only when distinguishing between groups with supposedly strong and weak interpersonal relations (alumni of one school vs mere profession), a positive outcome (i. e., lower default rate) is observable for groups with strong interpersonal relations.

Current tag-based recommender systems mainly take the explicit structural information among users, resources and tags into consideration, while neglecting the important implicit semantic relationships hidden in tagging data.

The outcome of a quantitative MIS research frequently reports significant factors of a causal model. Locating causal drivers is in some sense similar to feature selection in data mining. This study uses Bayesian regressions and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations to detect drivers in a research model of information systems study. Deviance information criterion is used to compare Bayesian models resulted from different prior distributions. Differential evolution and a deterministic type iterative procedure are proposed to find the best prior distribution, which is used to find drivers of the final Bayesian regression model. Experimental results show that these approaches can locate more interesting drivers of the research model.", "authors": [{"name": "Shing-Hwang  Doong", "ids": ["3250650"]}, {"name": "Tean Q.

We observe that, while our target data are sparse for CF systems, related and relatively dense auxiliary data may already exist in some other more mature application domains. In this paper, we address the data sparsity problem in a target domain by transferring knowledge about both users and items from auxiliary data sources. We observe that in different domains the user feedbacks are often heterogeneous such as ratings vs. clicks. Our solution is to integrate both user and item knowledge in auxiliary data sources through a principled matrix-based transfer learning framework that takes into account the data heterogeneity. In particular, we discover the principle coordinates of both users and items in the auxiliary data matrices, and transfer them to the target domain in order to reduce the effect of data sparsity. We describe our method, which is known as coordinate system transfer or CST, and demonstrate its effectiveness in alleviating the data sparsity problem in collaborative filtering. We show that our proposed method can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art solutions for this problem.", "authors": [{"name": "Weike  Pan", "ids": ["144282460"]}, {"name": "Evan Wei

The CS may be viewed as a complex adaptive system, in which individual components are linked through multiple feedback and feedforward loops. The non-linear relationships between the numerous coagulation factors and the interplay among the elements of the CS render the study of this biology at a molecular and cellular level nearly impossible. We present an Agent Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) approach for simulating these complex interactions. Our ABMS approach utilizes a subset of 52 rules to define the interactions among 33 enzymes and factors of the CS. These rules simulate the interaction of each \u201cagent\u201d, such as substrates, enzymes, and cofactors, on a two-dimensional grid of ~12,000 cells and ~300,000 agents. Our ABMS method successfully reproduces the initiation, propagation, and termination of thrombin formation due to the activation of the extrinsic pathway. Furthermore, the ABMS is able to demonstrate the emergence of a threshold effect for thrombin generation as a result of the synergistic effect of combining anticoagulant systems.", "authors": [{"name": "Nathan B.

To tackle it, an agent has to deal with perceptual information intelligently. In this paper, we propose an efficient and adaptive reasoning system based on Adaptive Logic Interpreter reasoning system, a mechanism for guiding inference through relational reinforcement learning, and a variation of Truth Maintenance Systems to speed up the inference. Relational reinforcement learning guides the inference toward the most rewarding parts of the knowledge base and truth maintenance system maintains beliefs, avoids repetitive inferences and reduces the state space. Empirical results demonstrate higher performance than the basic approach in terms of number of inferred instances, average reward, and average reward accuracy.", "authors": [{"name": "Mandana  Hamidi", "ids": ["143957657"]}, {"name": "Amir  Fijany", "ids": ["2710556"]}, {"name": "Jean-Guy  Fontaine", "ids": ["1775610"]}], "inCitations": ["cda5d6a2c82cccfaf1db902c6ffcdeee8632ead1"], "outCitations": ["d95a979638ef089a1bff56d9afa541e73ebd205f", "5009e04b4a06e6d3ce6d524856f6cdefd80f0443", "eb2f539a17487db2c93785214da2fc7a67a57840", "464eb245ff9822defa8db82c385ff1fd0b0b6ffe", "f08f699374a27cdbc2c1ecf050ae285b01bda723", "c810d7c1738cdb991efa89a96d369e49b611ee7a", "408fe5156ed7d7737e2d6a43e9dd6871280d694d", "ed3f9263e936a879092ad7a2bf27e0f94089ccd8", "b3751eacd2bc095f9e5a90f7d072ac62552e0b1c", "69bad87a51428789fb8db25fce10236faa8ba351", "37f3d3fa2d8f2560b24ec6ed3aaa38c8fe8d3512", "bb09f2cd352865f8ee082d39c1e5583a5d208445", "d66a76715184959268bb3d88d6eb35596fb0f8f8", "9d06638df32f8feefb95ef5a4769adbb1ae6297d"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/02ff48372dc9d3bbbac5317be05fc78333f639e2", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~hamidim/papers/ICMLA_hamidi27.pdf", "http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2010.67"], "venue": "2010 Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalName": "2010 Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "407-413", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2010.67", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2010.67", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2119985002", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Human validation is enabled through a game-with-a-purpose (GWAP) interface, gathering reliability judgements of assertions that can be used to aid the process of resource validation. Our experiments confirm that children aged 10 to 12 can be valuable and reliable partners in building commonsense databases, due to their stage of mental development and their eagerness to play GWAPs. Results show that children adapt their word choice in the assertions they provide to the difficulty level of the stimuli words, and that the judgements gathered through in-game validation can help to validate about 30% of the gathered statements automatically.", "authors": [{"name": "Antal van den Bosch", "ids": ["145977875"]}, {"name": "Pim  Nauts", "ids": ["2658244"]}, {"name": "Nienke  Eckhardt", "ids": ["2179484"]}], "inCitations": ["d763d95bf45c9a4ea51545d5447738f2d85d45fc", "d36d6a2e1ae1017dd3769e496996992c04676800", "15846b9d7826bf311f0f1636c16d3515e592f112", "1b97b4623cf2f183340e548e0aa53abf0f2963d8", "ab7c11a754ebb870aa43d153a93478962ac2678f", "4b6b082c839ab7ba755060583774fa548eb7a7ff", "1382e951677ae167638eb3c97054bb704e3bc359"], "outCitations": ["7ddded18bf2049325f128757be800c6d6b7d5975", "1be8f36741509864a06b87ef8dadfea6459b9fb2", "5385b3c2cef5138d2f4f9127ec7565eb8043a1c4", "eebb0ee46f32af2eb8abab294f5040f0fb383386", "83829d31cd18317ce12a8a0fcd71126b817cb96e", "0de0294aaa9fcc9ce0b435680c2a145562e9f4a4", "e3c9a4acc694000292d25b3727c662487208a8ee", "70e4a1ac020bff847061e0e9eefa042c2af39600", "8b2e9d7176144bcb9a0f1e3cf09fabf675085ed4", "43010b9433ce49cff445eb8c43b24650e6664d5d", "b4d02f42fd1638be451439451a8b9bb23d659a63", "c327a7ebea73df31edd9aca787add8289f667f64", "45a23651bcc5a6cc993d722e71b0d301a6dc9dee", "35759a54f37d0a3612e248706d9f64faac5ca254", "a2e7934350c1a8a6b934da8b158df50103eb8c4b", "76c880bd5bfa3c627a9497cd6f1ee0afa093e131", "f52cbfbedd119a772403727385bbd50f12e149be", "379d995a6dd83625ca5bde2379727c57a1bfc510", "c2d4a6e4900ec0f096c87bb2b1272eeceaa584a6", "494aedf82da4755badc1fe74e4d21cf5fc029e9d", "0f838b7cb39bf14b872db9feeaa5244fd9accf63", "b3fea597033a46d5ae282464a8f16d6715187e70", "244a174d417a8e5524a8a4593b244945c6e331a9", "0aaf533cac246fcd83490cd0b8508ed0d886ab7d", "1fd3e4e261c630be524801971fc0e7ab154298e6", "2bef0591b8bbab4760a84488949ad06cb3928909", "fa772fd0049de6d3643f71c5ed784f48bb7fc0b4", "b1e7bf85c7caf1306fa27802218a8e2cdc8f4268", "167136806b3a4234b76ba97515310360f7d57a71", "f39fcc3a36d6813721bc1c8254f9a2b292d12901", "89cbcc1e740a4591443ff4765a6ae8df0fdf5554", "b1efe271962d723069b095b45d1c623a8a5443c1", "e19f5d877488e2783d8e38a5a18fe33173d25df0", "f674bd704e680f57ec08549492e4444007facf9f", "a306fffc1854bd958b2e86e7085e45ae693e6388"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d079e8140fd1ad683e832c106c803bd70f0d8af3", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FSS/FSS10/paper/view/2287", "http://ilk.uvt.nl/downloads/pub/papers/GV_thesis_NienkeFINAL.pdf", "https://ilk.uvt.nl/downloads/pub/papers/FS10-02-026.pdf", "http://ilk.uvt.nl/downloads/pub/papers/FS10-02-026.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI Fall Symposium: Commonsense Knowledge", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "114-119", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1573836600", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

In the stage of off-line training, considering the unique contour, the concave and convex of the ear, we apply the extended haar-like features to construct the space of the weak classifiers using the nearest neighbor norms. And then we choose the Gentle AdaBoost algorithm to train the strong classifiers which form the cascaded multi-layer ear detector. In the stage of on-line detection, we apply two methods to speed up the detection procedure. The first one is to adjust the threshold of the strong classifiers to remain the like-ear sub windows for further processing only using the first two layer classifiers. The second one is to keep the size of the original image while scaling the detection sub-windows to locate the ear part. The ear detection experiments on USTB ear database, CAS-PEAL face database and CMU PIE database show that the proposed method is significantly efficient and robust.", "authors": [{"name": "Li  Yuan", "ids": ["145517652"]}, {"name": "Feng  Zhang", "ids": ["47190894"]}], "inCitations": ["c4ad9a99cdb60f7b66f4ef4416738a6de9991df2", "17af9f076b65021bf62d841f90268c6a21bbbc90", "790f238be7ad57f817916334b8c65687e513f65c", "787ba7b1260570b0ef0c1bf427ba63e0a110528d", "0f03f1bb36fc1b3ce49d777203961689456b311b", "36368362fddbdefba9d66da2fcdc392f8a712c8b", "db90d7c748d5fd97d331d89cf99d5cfc6c3a711e", "4d17b6df091dcca7109986da23c7ea46207d2e96", "3408b8cd911aa780b094bf7952bcd1fa232438e3", "e0a46f517db599f5ffdf4840ea63e31ee5050fc3", "bafbab2e61fff00c72d8588bcea71c93bc107051", "1480f47e3cb356627ad0fce1ddceee13e6b24e81"], "outCitations": ["5245862267bac7ae22e58e855675d9ac1dd24fe1", "ebac4bc69488d0339b0f1be55d79d3b2520e082a", "b4a051618f299e54e9f4be597dccd2148fd2b1f0", "4cb4d685b47001652b29dc41c1b3e786277e7647", "ce3af5ccd47704252b2ec6bf4588c08b4435d32b", "f44fb5ca0ffbccec6653196c58cf5a007f7d27da"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1e3adf2a220fa10b3a4534e07df23e8a4eb60703", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "4", "journalPages": "2414-2417", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212166", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212166", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2104691754", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

This has generated great interest in researching these networks by various fields in the scientific community. One key aspect of social network research is identifying important missing information which is not explicitly represented in the network, or is not visible to all. To date, this line of research typically focused on what connections were missing between nodes, or what is termed the \"Missing Link Problem\". This paper introduces a new Missing Nodes Identification problem where missing members in the social network structure must be identified. Towards solving this problem, we present an approach based on clustering algorithms combined with measures from missing link research. We show that this approach has beneficial results in the missing nodes identification process and we measure its performance in several different scenarios.", "authors": [{"name": "Ron  Eyal", "ids": ["1901698"]}, {"name": "Sarit  Kraus", "ids": ["144992450"]}, {"name": "Avi  Rosenfeld", "ids": ["40110198"]}], "inCitations": ["0356727286c3fa706c98e6dbaaeb6fba6edc6716", "2e1cc812e7e4cbfcc38410b1beb67f0f290414af", "337f3336e4d19a683975e1a69f296bce217e387a", "ecf84f16e75c379ed8f7c1cf523fcabacdc8100b", "20bff024f9ad3f983e06e4e690265d314d733522", "c27396271c9dad171694e750c0267b9fdb1e9ac3", "c27302718013afcf7837062499f8808090ebe8a6", "c9aa117d8c2d7627f1717c4f210195304366d951", "e7bee6a8a6ada5072322ae0980b6034e55424239", "1f7ac558115b8e0fcb622a9146697b3d19d23112", "36f775232c46d7e05f3053be848ace520f1fd140", "1925f912dae7a0d5be440b3b6bc864ceb574d902", "bd932a34b4c1279d54d17571c7b9dd864db3e817"], "outCitations": ["a9f1d1051377eb51b04796c316a48a2de1bf4532", "8dc9d11e3fc229a1b70bb00de72dc15d55848174", "eda90bd43f4256986688e525b45b833a3addab97", "a4903aea23b66bf0680430f52fe4f5fa88379580", "c02dfd94b11933093c797c362e2f8f6a3b9b8012", "9be428c9383d47b86570b1b9fc20faf006346c5d", "00b7ffd43e9b6b70c80449872a8c9ec49c7d045a", "4524672008dfac045b21758b1be9b5defacf8104", "f1d40a639d7f83d373f07b2bf4a96f0313b584d8", "17a9ca07e135f0bf2a5738e72ccb9c817cae1eb8", "beecc2eb2b2a9754668110d07ab98e52d870ad28"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ccf4c3ef9bd412c6724db8fc95771d355da18972", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~sarit/data/articles/Eyaletalaai2011.pdf", "http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~sarit/data/articles/Eyaletalaai2011.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/view/3682", "http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~sarit/data/articles/Eyaletalaaai2011.pdf", "http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/users/sarit/data/articles/Eyaletalaai2011.pdf", "http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~sarit/data/articles//Eyaletalaai2011.pdf", "http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~sarit/data/articles//Eyaletalaaai2011.pdf", "http://www.cs.biu.ac.il/~sarit/data/articles/Eyaletalaaai2011.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/download/3682/4076", "http://homedir.jct.ac.il/~rosenfa/papers/AAAI2011.pdf", "http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/users/sarit/data/articles/Eyaletalaaai2011.pdf", "http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~sarit/data/articles/Eyaletalaaai2011.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1166-1172", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2219154195", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Currently most of the hard drive vendors support self-monitoring, analysis and reporting technology (SMART) which are often considered unreliable for such tasks. The problem of finding alternatives to SMART for predicting disk failure is an area of active research. In this paper, we consider events recorded from live disks and show that it is possible to construct decision support systems which can detect such failures. It is desired that any such prediction methodology should have high accuracy and ease of interpretability. Black box models can deliver highly accurate solutions but do not provide an understanding of events which explains the decision given by it. To this end we explore rule based classifiers for predicting hard disk failures from various disk events. We show that it is possible to learn easy to understand rules, from disk events, which have extremely low false alarm rates on real world data.", "authors": [{"name": "Vipul  Agarwal", "ids": ["2058910"]}, {"name": "Chiranjib  Bhattacharyya", "ids": ["145880755"]}, {"name": "Thirumale  Niranjan", "ids": ["145266769"]}, {"name": "Sai  Susarla", "ids": ["144486592"]}], "inCitations": ["897c05f0143e15a2c254a9d78abf01ad7468b8f7", "3794af8c5092a363803295971268a8b98a254143", "73c13020823a714b6ccba45fc1f25794adf94b74", "541ecbd59f56d3f7a20a79931ecc5ae2aca6b4c1", "d13c52d511fa0c27486544432d539ec6ab2b3e9a", "4e3f3e8fac02334a3621f98dbe665505424a0751", "4ba22feeaf46f886173036e6f06d1238ca7a22eb", "50b2c01109db0f39e24359c836a24c915d3a0b36", "51c272042862325c0e8e3bf6e5dbbeabd4082178", "074a7b7c8733df0e81b1534741c4608e8a0e745d", "a24f40c9316f08ba075e9e90b5fb247a89244807", "bb541de8073fe79c3832fd00044246858ddcd71b", "61a3e16210c7a026969cdcc62135449b9b90d100", "8d27278f4c72885999a848014c5f825d1bffdf0f", "e21fc2711f792e583c94330f02d8ed04fc24e788", "9527893bee85c1961846e7c3c3bc45dacaac2e72", "f973d50d3965599e576916d05065aec7aa91281d"], "outCitations": ["6762b752bccaa420d6cfeb2c81d2f4fac3d33702", "9d06638df32f8feefb95ef5a4769adbb1ae6297d", "562a596836f42714d81e1f861671959ba12e0246", "5dbefa4a834388c61f010e506b97921b30a276d4", "2a9ff343e70eca6156e80f6efbbe9f0b9c55f9f0", "00d0f20c16ab208171d6493cd1c83a99d1056b93", "7827f3bbfe3e2713d69b74e1a87547f36eae3c58", "bacfad53f881d053467e82c7884ddcf79a06c856", "2cda32ac344f42b6f585817cedee0236ee158465", "b9c0c9ce75b4abe8f08cd653d136053edb8edb16", "8c599b23138bb879078fcb889a27bed0bc49dfcb", "f3b85bf1f1069e76a6d47865b01925a57ebf39ca"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f7ea5e0084acca6cf88a2984629e9880d22401c3", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://atg.netapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/disk_failure_prediction_icmla.pdf", "http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2009.62", "http://mllab.csa.iisc.ernet.in/html/pubs/disk_failure_prediction_icmla.pdf"], "venue": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalName": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "782-786", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2009.62", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2009.62", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2172047636", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Hence, the identification of influential bloggers automatically has become an important task. Previous researches focus on the blog sites in which there exist abundant hyperlinks, but their methods can not scale to ones that have few hyperlinks. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called SimRank to recommend influential bloggers. Our algorithm is based on the observation that the reproduction of blog posts and similar contents is common in blogosphere, which form implicit links between bloggers. By measuring the text similarity of the blog posts, we create link graph between bloggers, and adopt the PageRank algorithm to rank the importance of bloggers.

Parametric models flexible enough to capture all mobility patterns that an expert believes are possible are often large, requiring a great deal of training data. In contrast, nonparametric models are extremely flexible and can generalize well with relatively little training data. We propose modeling the mobility patterns of moving agents as a mixture of Gaussian processes (GP) with a Dirichlet process (DP) prior over mixture weights. The GP provides a flexible representation for each individual mobility pattern, while the DP assigns observed trajectories to particular mobility patterns. Both the GPs and the DP adjust the model's complexity based on available data, implicitly avoiding issues of over-fitting or under-fitting. We apply our model to a helicopter-based tracking task, where the mobility patterns of the tracked agents\u2014cars\u2014are learned from real data collected from taxis in the greater Boston area.", "authors": [{"name": "Joshua Mason Joseph", "ids": ["2637940"]}, {"name": "Finale  Doshi-Velez", "ids": ["1388372395"]}, {"name": "Nicholas  Roy", "ids": ["143724999"]}], "inCitations": ["e6f4c995692fd8632ed234803058f21ebf43bdda", "c65407a1a25b3e47cbf21b50bd02c929f9cb5ed4", "f18abc31ccd254d89251d6cce5b831478054de16", "92ecfde66cb65cee94ae7c3986dd3636e635e908", "f5783d21492ceeec6cfcf42595d270dedbb91d5e", "92c412d74205d8e534b7e8f1ad97dc7fcf1e5b11", "b007a5393afa65348d1feb58877cc8bb75d7b133", "63a65ca523f1a3eea1536ccc16618e368ff6815b", "3b2825c4ad3f4af593ba29f8885e40c948f944a9", "1dba9b34533e5d464a37f2b801721e1b1a7b7cd5", "c0efa3c424a15a43c485652e5ea8ebd2c4bc2105", "b9fd025a3505b201e9790ee929e406e6a0318225", "2774f1eb7a01c4c05c7b8dd949db4f352ff6e8f1", "32ca825aa9d4bdbcd067d59492512ff35d5edb6f", "31fcf570c22cbcb74ec4dc0ee6528d6ae1363e57", "9f8211a7c934463bd59f3b12e1df7431b65ffc85", "eb59dfc98fc88ee24769eb80a3567ddcf5902647", "501c23a360179daf592af00e12e2f9ca8a96e7f8", "9d891113918e1f1c8de0f2320f220c19269c78a6", "8e91bd3961126a583b816f2bbd69cad3a4eaa5a9", "b8c2626a8d27fcc9def7421a6d1ae16eb4d83473", "e4f343ab2149334d04bfc7ec86e678b8fdf22212", "cf766e70abad57a6726aba1ec93d6b6be4e14307", "2428cabdf18bbf6d0e7c921c40a8ddba37742644", "661c223c11a1845d758ba58251bf2a34bff856f4", "b28c0c4890f0ed715ba2cc48a9f61291b203fa1b", "9ae2831a78acc4869107d377090b120653dd9f56", "c5d539d42d71464e2c72b2dc3b159101615f6626", "95887cb48fe1fdf20e200f8e28585fdefea92fd6", "79e8af07d7be3e41ebdc2d1a219d5c867693bf4c", "701e14589d4df3b63140552cb32115aded1e927f"], "outCitations": ["11b6bdfe36c48b11367b27187da11d95892f0361", "8090121ad488b4af27bc59bf91b62e9c6a6f49c6", "ae8f9768ffcda5bb055e78b94dd5cc281c0f7bb5", "51c41c33908ebda05c4863474423a36d20c3b8ae", "2578219742857f4af310b003c03f607ed01d79f8", "480d517574a079d3e0159b978cb19b3f014e59a3", "34efd437788160bb90b5b62684d0813edd44c1c6", "646be9e0d7d7c93599f216d56ed6c5dcded7e09c", "7d9c0b209730a06cd9cb69b4720bcdb77aef9f80", "1d41d6ec4805f80b84a1ccd17f6753ba71e107f7", "5854882e9da496fda4c6bda98924c22367aa5e6d", "932a106c21a1db1e1876459c1521d27fd152caac", "5079ea296646fbbb0c1ceb8bbadf86c698c842ef", "56eb08d2dfc6da2e434e6bb83c0bd2388f5bbfcc", "75f063c9b32912f4b1b1f08dbcf6b0575ce16bf1", "5623dcbab3b23039b74ca15c18572dda8bfc7752", "216611dd04e6a9995ffd64f60bcc8f64a63a57ce"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6d999960966e87110b2d975c46d35b588900dde4", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://finale.seas.harvard.edu/files/finale/files/2010a_bayesian_nonparametric_approach_to_modeling_mobility_patterns.pdf?m=1455121602", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1558", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1558/2261", "http://people.csail.mit.edu/finale/papers/jmjoseph_aaai10.pdf", "http://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/papers/aaai10-jj.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1587-1593", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "3021198771", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

It turns out that when the cluster assumption holds, that is, when the high density regions are suf\ufb01ciently separated by low density valleys, each high density area corresponds to a unique representative eigenvector. Linear combination of such eigenvectors (or, more precisely, of their Nystrom extensions) provide good candidates for good classi\ufb01cation functions. By \ufb01rst choosing an appropriate basis of these eigenvectors from unlabeled data and then using labeled data with Lasso to select a classi\ufb01er in the span of these eigenvectors, we obtain a classi\ufb01er, which has a very sparse representation in this basis. Importantly, the sparsity appears naturally from the cluster assumption. Experimental results on a number of real-world datasets show that our method is competitive with the state of the art semi-supervised learning algorithms and out-performs the natural base-line algorithm (Lasso in the Kernel PCA basis).", "authors": [{"name": "Kaushik  Sinha", "ids": ["40523939"]}, {"name": "Mikhail  Belkin", "ids": ["145520115"]}], "inCitations": ["b6e85ec71a211c85812a92440aeb689056d73e5e", "acc1b68bc24aaff0263b0d7b7698791661425991", "c9e2185686d40da6d51f46138ec54a8cf3df34c2", "99b38c45d977864d30a122534da336f20751419a", "305dc16eca93e819e2913e465ea4ec8244880c3f", "bd9cc484dc870fa6551973bc1591143f967472cb", "d5150fca3d242c1d3341b56d75ee504cf70bc7a7", "aec35d7fb3b21e8ef7d93ec634c35227879cb290", "6bdf8824c903d98802a44ef962563891565d8d2a", "7a9b4806d2ca7ce2dec728211eecc31270867a94", "d1b2360f851803415ae84983b05d9ccb871d3c0c", "34a85fccdf4f9e72024b6b58ae47a147e97fc297", "1f80b0de606f2febf0f860ad1b3847dcd9b8d718", "c5c1d925916d373e1f872474478d14a7726d15bd", "86a1e6d24edce078a939b085f71c3ce689782882", "219a02f1866b222cdbcf3abd3d2f997bf908f808", "5c01098e69fe85fa612f095592b52b1611e4cacf", "1c1a4ac1a6058ccfe53f38fa1fb0c0205b9ba88b", "9a07b47138fef0518d65bef5157cbbad4c8a6225", "86fff2ed7320aa9a8a6025b5d60363c05715b9db", "f907f20ca92e6d276031c3a02a1c31feedccb047", "419b490cb644c9ae3a2b47f100d6bbe2419d1319", "d398f361815b776015f920858e4a1e25dba0a299", "fbde297768c0c23fd9c2e659dc6399064bc2b425", "d517b13f2b152c913b81ce534a149493517dbdad", "a05e8c4791bd6295df12bd184b97547b00f784e2", "78b7ba16eea9c874e2ff7fc5e6c861c24ce8f0ce", "39d96d63c87641db47821fd2dc60ca0994e18cc8", "d88207e1edff90a549413fafd71abafc7afa9838", "a0cc9f66d2b1d1f87b0967602703f386aa858eb4", "e1bf18d2933e5f24d598fcaa5318c45cea373c39", "7084fbc8252bc7e5abbd74c5bfe78cce749cf839", "87ccd3e61d2a70794a65fac03f158b90d867d3d2", "d01984cc6d2a08d51bf08169461764017af8d975", "bc2f3440dfa1472f8567ed48884ca110bc4ac798", "f04fe8c75a9d0ae07884defe30048e20cbdcf2da", "8e4fbea42fc84592b0c19ef5b397f2d555dc017a", "eb0d4d69544164ff94e9917631100e8a3b81d6b3", "a88cb4d87642f65c9d63d32c918647bd0d787a72", "a4cea83aaaeaa82f45460b1cac9821605d24bf00", "3d294a373c7888c9a3d4f5c62d55619c9bf572c9", "d70f91b197d884aa78886452c0b6908cde451233", "afba259070283bd085de94dc89510115a3b71a41"], "outCitations": ["5db89746b77118f1f6c65f2b47d4074bcba55fa9", "18c7ab1b96e088f8c881508e6ec53b50326ad27d", "0b0e41a73d3158b909b9552d787639ff461d7716", "3f600e6c6cf93e78c9e6e690443d6d22c4bf18b9", "19bb0dce99466077e9bc5a2ad4941607fc28b40c", "6aa2fbce055510bd8c0f7ddf9c22b53bca1062ea", "46ee0292a71fa86a9e2f9d691da5f0f1cf281f83", "97da69876da58c096580c641ba772b84932844b1", "5f39fe2659603f4194fd638d1a2e17985415c3bb", "6bbc0c752570c46a772f2982728f9ad4191f25dd", "22834aa74138de7f4da42fb9dfb480cef4e7b177", "dc5b06753fac11268bc2300b7c25d50cbbcdeb5c", "5a002b24c0a8a63527a8c0e0681d4747e227aa6f", "bee570503aaa0ed5bc5dd4cf6aa742df0b5cef87", "0502223d9665fa1aefc612998f08044241612489", "b365b8e45b7d81f081de44ac8f9eadf9144f3ca5", "53dcb8199cda481d67663efd29f0d80f6f29bf32", "841596e7980536426b91519adb0c73f2f0f9fc86"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6ec11028aec59e309122a5f29a34b6cd284f8c7a", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3852-semi-supervised-learning-using-sparse-eigenfunction-bases.pdf", "http://books.nips.cc/papers/files/nips22/NIPS2009_1025.pdf", "http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3852-semi-supervised-learning-using-sparse-eigenfunction-bases.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FSS/FSS09/paper/download/989/1221", "http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/mlpapers/paper_files/NIPS2009_1025.pdf", "http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3852-semi-supervised-learning-using-sparse-eigenfunction-bases", "http://www.cs.wichita.edu/~sinha/papers/eigen_base_nips09.pdf", "http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~mbelkin/papers/SSL_SEB_NIPS_09.pdf", "http://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FSS/FSS09/paper/view/989", "http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~mbelkin/papers/SSL_SEB_NIPS_09.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI Fall Symposium: Manifold Learning and Its Applications", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1687-1695", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "magId": "2405646695", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

The features are then extracted from the grayscale image, based on a descriptive statistics of the image and its corresponding face components. The edges of a face image and its corresponding face components are detected by using the canny algorithm. In the recognition step, different classifiers such as Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k -Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Pairwise Opposite Class-Nearest Neighbor (POC-NN) can be used for face recognition. We evaluated our method with more conventional Eigenface method based upon the AT&T and Yale face databases. The evaluation clearly confirm that for both databases our proposed method yields a higher recognition rate and requires less computational time than the Eigenface method.", "authors": [{"name": "R.

Chinese NER is usually formalized as a chunking task. However, most formulations do not distinguish named entities from common words. This makes it difficult to explore lexical cues for NER. In this paper we propose a two-level IOB2 representation to merge lexical chunks and entity chunks, and develop a morpheme-based chunking system for Chinese NER. It works in three main steps: Given a plain Chinese sentence, a morpheme segmenter first segments it into a sequence of morphemes, then a lexical chunker is applied to tag each segmented morpheme with a proper lexical chunk tag indicating its position pattern in forming a word of a special type, and finally an entity chunker continues to label each morpheme with a hybrid chunk tag, containing the related entity boundary and category information if any. Our experiments on the IEER-99 and MET2 data demonstrate a significant enhancement of NER performance after using entity-internal part-of-speech information. We also show that lexical chunking quality is of importance for NER results.", "authors": [{"name": "Guo-Hong  Fu", "ids": ["2066755"]}], "inCitations": ["debd0030de4c77e51bf3aa9456b1df5beb8d8ffe", "e74eb0964d1555612b19542b74310b85a6a768ec"], "outCitations": ["1e1fc58c7a09a71bc1cc1ca80b87770c5aac606c", "8b1835926adc40b10fb3cc47620b655679e35ead", "51bdd0b839fe8ab1daafa05d1ed03edff601f4c7", "0617dd6924df7a3491c299772b70e90507b195dc", "10f97f1fb4f5c2c8e6c44d4a33da46d331dd4aeb", "2d0fab1d9921bdd00f9290f04c17561cf8292ccb", "603a51a93999b7230f47573de4610675bbd966a8", "9d9210fe2ddf4219a8bc39483512cdb1ef189eba", "1ba84863e2685c45c5c41953444d9383dc7aa13b", "7c3c13060b7101816a11566eda4fa21d2a82af9e", "196fd77d4d49295c5dbe8df5af0afa43880a836e", "b565cbbd4bb1487b98a08f8772edb99d63c8c8e4", "c358224cdb296512eba8aebe22ce351b8f76aa43", "85c7e7979263aea289fbae2deb94ce2bcd47dbbe"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/94131466e36f8078e9dd572ba618ff390b55d241", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "6", "journalPages": "3487-3491", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212793", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212793", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2125103075", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

This paper presents a method for deriving attributional rules that can be used to support the preparation and screening of claims prior to their submission to payers. The method starts with unsupervised analysis of past payments to determine normal levels of payments for services. Then, supervised machine learning is used to derive sets of attributional rules for predicting potential discrepancies in claims. New claims can be then classified using the created models. The method was tested on a subset of Obstetrics claims for payment submitted by one hospital to Medicaid. One year of data was used to create models, which were tested using the following year's data.

Other algorithms adopt a generate-and-test approach, retrieving candidate analogies by superficial similarity of concepts, then testing them for the particular relations involved in the analogy. CROSSBRIDGE adopts a global approach. It organizes the entire knowledge space at once, as a matrix of small conceptand-relation subgraph patterns versus actual occurrences of subgraphs from the knowledge base. It uses the familiar mathematics of dimensionality reduction to reorganize this space along dimensions representing approximate semantic similarity of these subgraphs. Analogies can then be retrieved by simple nearest-neighbor comparison. CROSSBRIDGE also takes into account not only knowledge directly related to the source and target domains, but also a large background Commonsense knowledge base. Commonsense influences the mapping between domains, preserving important relations while ignoring others. This property allows CROSSBRIDGE to find more intuitive and extensible analogies. We compare our approach with an implementation of structure mapping and show that our algorithm consistently finds analogies in cases where structure mapping fails.

These social networks are rich in information about entities like hobbies, demographic information, friendship, and other attributes. This information can be used extensively for network analysis. One of the most important problems in social network analysis is community detection. The community detection problem is closely related to graph clustering. Most of the existing graph clustering algorithms employ only the structure of a graph to find highly connected components. These algorithms ignore nodes' attributes that can help in improving the quality of the clustering. In this paper, we propose a clustering algorithm which clusters a graph by incorporating both the topological structure of the graph as well as attribute information. The aim is to find clusters such that the nodes in each cluster are similar in the attribute space. In terms of social networks, we are looking to find communities where the members of the same community have similar profiles. The method was evaluated using real and synthetic graph datasets.

We propose the notion of anticipatory action and perception for for robots acting with humans. We describe four systems in which anticipation has been modeled for human-robot interaction; two in a teamwork setting, and two in a human-robot joint performance setting. In evaluating the effects of anticipatory agent activity, we find in one study that anticipation aids in team efficiency, as well as in the perceived commitment of the robot to the team and its contribution to the team's fluency and success. In another study we see anticipatory action and perception affect the human partner's sense of team fluency, the team's improvement over time, the robot\u2019s contribution to the efficiency and fluency, the robot's intelligence, and the robot\u2019s adaptation to the task.

The technique of cube learning has been developed to help them prune satisfying assignments. Cubes, however, have not been able to achieve the same degree of effectiveness as clauses. In this paper we demonstrate how a circuit representation for QBF can support the propagation of dual truth values. The dual values support the identical techniques of unit propagation and clause learning, except now it is satisfying assignments rather than falsifying assignments that are pruned. Dual value propagation thus exploits the circuit representation and the duality of QBF formulas so that the same effective SAT techniques can now be used to prune both falsifying and satisfyingly assignments. We show empirically that dual propagation yields significant performance improvements and advances the state of the art in QBF solving.", "authors": [{"name": "Alexandra  Goultiaeva", "ids": ["2298206"]}, {"name": "Fahiem  Bacchus", "ids": ["1736882"]}], "inCitations": ["0837933f420ed4001c346cf44219bcb651109b16", "cdafe7de931c5fd09a757b66e36b24cb891acec3", "f64165e45898222af6f42110aa7b3af69b2bcc3a", "afe2c31c357ecaacec23befc4f6d7c182ac17abd", "fc18ac1d3913b97c76435d01c3f6c44eb92a84dd", "051fcdf9b7cb39ca1e55703f531672d19a760656", "12eaf08901ed8ccdc10731e5dcd13a1b6e9cfbf6", "893cfb4e55360bca38ee04ac5285dc03c4336093", "e8fcadd11009c8d1e0a9212ec18673e9c1de3cf0", "ddbab8377c72477ace81031ae103025e4de66d8a", "6790d3728a3454783e4ea84a9cc0fab103324e17", "3c20d67af809c203a7fa025742ad261cbf147acf", "b2016e140d54f116ffd6d4e4ff418f2426c3463a", "8dcd4270f78aa8ba44aff13f14fae19d67e0aa51", "7a52ad5a6377d1c66117f76aff98edde00eff37a", "210fd077acfa79ed3c4fd20f1cfeb8ee5080248c", "7bbec20dddaba46bda923110044554eedad47f64", "d1b877528e2f420b1b477a3e8bdf2c0a7f8a3e24", "a2e3844ad22df0d16ab8b4b23529ad09ca0d5dae", "40045cdc92599bc12ef3a5be98b346bf215662d2", "6513e8e75c422ca8509baf9aa83c677c6021a43d", "82f9657bbf11cf4dfc1c012b966e94846e3597ee", "a0229fb0e40ecef467aee485110ed0d5960eace4", "85c0a761ccfae1edcf9e2d3760abfb790aec3bd3", "9039a53ace4eeb6ab2852e197b9dd6fad2f0747c", "d2e265e036f887d5c50c14ab2101373346f7ce00", "9acb670388d6f1d50c419a365ffe0801b05bcf3e", "3eab7c75144391ea8b26b2dd00b15e1559968675", "fe90cdbf675563cf6189c823cd774f0026d0dc7a", "8a9c205a4359425aaab75781c0bad78293e39418", "345e9495f867837cd6490e09d036d1629b0f1512", "86b10dea25fdec8a94547a49c0dada07397b0db0", "ddecc36eabde155e76be6d6a15ea1086128571da"], "outCitations": ["8a53a5a254de9d86ddc54d2c16dd41cecb37615f", "3647a7c32a7f80a0b7560bfe958392bcb13da2c4", "3261a8da5e8be03ed7f6af883c3d955cd7207c93", "746537c862781aab3ab2869fd276f7d8ca0d4d8d", "4a694d6ac26f45079809ba55bb8aa0517e5e2561", "93d81f20080019820b0b8179bb5de45b1e99a095", "3ccab905e83f38d7deef7d19d49df599d7be3d08", "8b42a5a34c55dd151b9bb84799830212e0c1280d", "e39d3141fded153348249560b4f668f731afdf02", "4d0c444a18ae12daf673e311164c09f0116371d5", "42a6e5557ba64f9f6c240f9c146fdcbcd87f1ad8", "a93beb012f2bb4aa58ede0db0a30642f746fec90", "4d9fe7cc79e9365223869aa60598f4c3a5abc9c9", "323534b1c0a532906d3015483eb59f70e62257a3", "2d6e0f420b46f8b97c18531fd824eb64e21e9bd1"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d4dea5d74cad6cce93fc5228893b0edf03ecb655", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1791/1928", "http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fbacchus/Papers/GB_AAAI2010.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1791", "http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fbacchus/csc2512/Lectures/Student%20Presentations/CirQit_Nargesian.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "71-76", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "129935311", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Xerostomia can be modeled based on the dose to the parotid glands. To date, all spatial information has been discarded and dose-response models are usually reduced to the mean dose. We present novel morphological dose-response models and use multivariate Bayesian logistic regression to model xerostomia. We use 3D invariant statistical moments as morphometric descriptors to quantify the shape of the 3D dose distribution. As this results in a very high number of potential predictors, we apply a Bayesian variable-selection algorithm to find the best model based on any subset of all potential predictors. To do this, we determine the posterior probabilities of being the best model for all potential models and calculate the marginal probabilities that a variable should be included in a model. This was done using a Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The performance of the best model was quantified using the deviance information criterion and a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). This methodology was applied to 64 head and neck cancer patients treated with either intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or conventional radiotherapy. Results show a substantial increase in both model-fit and area under the curve (AUC) when including morphological information compared to conventional mean-dose models. The best mean-dose model for IMRT patients only resulted in an AUC of 0.63 after LOOCV while the best morphological model had an AUC of 0.90. For conventional patients the mean-dose model and the morphological model had AUC of 0.55 and 0.86 respectively. For a joint model with all patients pooled together, the mean dose model had an AUC of 0.75 and the morphological model an AUC of 0.88. We have shown that invariant statistical moments are a good morphometric descriptor and by using Bayesian variable selection we were able to identify models with a substantially higher predictive power than conventional mean-dose models.", "authors": [{"name": "Florian  Buettner", "ids": ["50221241"]}, {"name": "Sarah  Gulliford", "ids": ["2928682"]}, {"name": "Steve  Webb", "ids": ["145071876"]}, {"name": "Mike  Partridge", "ids": ["144030457"]}, {"name": "Aisha B.

It automatically controls the generation on which it exchanges ACO for EAX by observing diversity and convergence of chromosomes generated by ACO with both lengths and their variance. It uses ACO in early stage of generations to create variable local optimum solutions and it uses EAX in later stage of generations efficiently to generate global optimum solutions using chromosomes generated by ACO.

A great number of digital mammograms are generated in hospitals and screening centers. Those digital mammograms can further be used for study and research by medical professionals. Content-based image retrieval refers to the retrieval of images whose contents are similar to a query example, using information derived from the images themselves. Relevance feedback, expressing the user's search target, can be used to bridge the semantic gap and improve the performance of CBIR systems. This study proposes a learning method for relevance feedback learning, which develops multiple logistic regression models to generalize the classification problem and provide an estimate of probability of class membership. To build the model, relevance feedback is utilized as the training data and the IRLS method is applied to estimate the parameters of the regression model and compute the maximum likelihood. Logistic regression models are created individually. After logistic regression models are fitted, discriminating features are selected by the measure of goodness of fit statistics. The weights of those discriminating features can be assigned according to their individual contributions to the maximum likelihood. The probability of the membership of the relevant class can therefore be obtained for each image of the database. Experimental results show that the proposed learning method can effectively improve the average precision from 30% to 65% through five iterations of relevance feedback rounds.", "authors": [{"name": "Yue  Li", "ids": ["145072468"]}, {"name": "Chia-Hung  Wei", "ids": ["3084130"]}], "inCitations": ["a10e4c6bd8f5e38be3412fd4e0e8cbb4bbcc7fd2", "5fac12762ebb2056dc608ae788e09b6cac1fc373"], "outCitations": ["2d1ea1b34f9ffb36638c380eb73d1c69385ddf62", "713e9f14f23568be4a9a24c6754099a0b208f8f7", "60dd4c09cca2f52b7bcbe7fcf378d015845c608d", "8944b3703c357dbf649f473badd380a2e119ce8d", "f5985277e1452ee8d06be1876ed5919fb31c8dad", "a696826649cc7f2f34efae5530788314f337c7bc"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/37d11491c25176e76de56fcc721a9a6212150d8e", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016984"], "venue": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "4", "journalPages": "1436-1443", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016984", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016984", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2156469849", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Our method made use of linguistic patterns for identifying the amino acid residue mentions in text. Further, we applied an automated graph-based method to learn syntactic and semantic patterns corresponding to protein-residue pairs mentioned in the text. On a new automatically generated data set of high confidence protein-residue relationship sentences, established through distant supervision, the method achieved a F-measure of 0.78.

In contrast, it is difficult for a MLP to form closed circular or elliptic classification borders, and for RBFN to form open plane classification borders. Hence, MLP and RBFN have their own advantages and disadvantages in dealing with various classification problems. To combine their advantages, in this paper, we proposed a novel neural network, Hybrid Transfer Function Network (HTFN), whose hidden layer contains sigmoid and Gaussian units at the same time. Although there are two kinds of processing units in HTFN, in this study, we used the principle of minimizing error sum of squares to derive the supervised learning rules for all the network parameters. When HTFN contains only either sigmoid units or Gaussian units in its hidden layer, HTFN can be transferred into MLP and RBFN, respectively. Hence, MLP and RBFN can be considered as a special case of HTFN. To verify that HTFN is superior to MLP and RBFN, this study employed three man-made examples to test the three networks. The results showed that HTFN is more accurate than MLP and RBFN, confirming that combining sigmoid and Gaussian units into hidden layer can combine advantages of MLP and RBFN.", "authors": [{"name": "I-Cheng  Yeh", "ids": ["144957987"]}, {"name": "Chung-Chih  Chen", "ids": ["3063028"]}, {"name": "Kuan-Chieh  Huang", "ids": ["1678814"]}], "inCitations": ["50971504f8afc9cdba69e6d3adea4fadfa0d657a", "c8bef0f39d6eb7eb113f5e451b931730b45e04ad"], "outCitations": ["0dfe744bf11e2df02560c5df6d61caff5a2e6f9d", "fe2ee9be5a9d04022cce78f237fcd56c653667aa", "110adb74606af7c4f8c3261305f6e606e85c877d", "717725e95923c5b8b4fd6330b8900147f7f7b6c8", "e96586f330e8d7011317b298524f66990008704c", "76a9b07e725081cd282eed119cbf6fe3fadc3976", "2fda1ac25568817545b21b4276b02d219632b95a", "3a4daec37859e154f86d91619e77b4428dcd7fe3"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4f33a38716598970bb703e36d72d147e2b6af339", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5581096"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "1", "journalPages": "37-42", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5581096", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5581096", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2070191777", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

The strategies employed with classification filters are not ideal, particularly when learning from class-imbalanced data.

Recently, most studies have been focused on using an efficient data structure with preprocessing data for the frequent closed itemset mining. Existing prefix-tree-based approach presented the IT-Tree data structure in its complete preprocessing data for the efficient frequent searching but used large memory space and time consuming in the preprocessing step. Lately, another approach introduced the efficient data structure, called \u201ca collaboration of array, bitmap, and prefix tree\u201d, to improve storage and time in preprocessing data. However, its preprocessing step was not complete and hence its frequent searching for the frequent closed itemset mining may take more time than that of the IT-Tree-based approach.

In response to the subjectivity and fuzziness of TCM, quantitative methods are needed. In TCM, the symptoms are often high dimensional and the redundant and irrelevant symptoms may degrade the performance of classifiers. Therefore, a critical procedure in syndrome differentiation is identifying a representative set of features from which to construct a diagnostic model. Then one central problem in diagnosis is how the feature selection can influence the predictive accuracy. This problem was addressed in this work and a comparative analysis of seven important different feature selection methods is performed incorporating with learning algorithms. Two machine learning algorithms were used: decision tree (DT) and Bayesian networks (BNs). We utilize feature selection algorithm prior to the learning phase.

According to [11] and [10], this new approach offers better results than the traditional approaches based on rules such as the decision trees. It also offers a great flexibility with the unstructured data. However, this approach suffers from a huge mass of generated rules which leads to a waste of time and space. In this work, we propose a new associative classification method. This method is based on FCP-Growth-P, an algorithm which generates only class itemsets and integrates for pruning the specialization condition of Li. Thus one saves both execution time and storage space. The phase of classification is based on a reduced base of the most significant rules leading to each class, which ensures the speed of the method.

{"id": "143dd9be87c16cc6e5d602a783869a0e006f25a3", "title": "Prediction of Foreign Exchange Market States with Support Vector Machine", "text": "This paper proposes a method to give an early warning of an abrupt change of price in a foreign exchange market. Volatility is a quantification of how much a value moves in a time series. It is now customary to assume that volatility of foreign exchange markets is time-varying. Intuitively we observe that there are at least two states or regimes: one is with low volatility and the other is with high volatility. Under high volatility regime, there are chances of high returns but with very high risks. For many nonprofessional traders, the high volatility regimes are periods that they loose with high probability. We believe that giving an early alert of starts of high volatility regimes is beneficial for many nonprofessional traders and for the foreign exchange markets. There are many studies to predict volatility of foreign exchange market by using ARCH or GARCH model with possibly hidden Markov model to represent regimes.

In this paper, we extend an existing HTN planner with a new state projection algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first HTN planner that can reason about nonlinear continuous effects. We use a wait action to instruct this planner to consider continuous effects in a given state. We also introduce a new planning domain to demonstrate the benefits of planning with nonlinear continuous effects. We compare our approach with a linear continuous effects planner and a discrete effects HTN planner on a benchmark domain, which reveals that its additional costs are largely mitigated by domain knowledge. Finally, we present an initial application of this algorithm in a practical domain, a Navy training simulation, illustrating the utility of this approach for planning in dynamic continuous environments.", "authors": [{"name": "Matthew  Molineaux", "ids": ["2655043"]}, {"name": "Matthew  Klenk", "ids": ["1811545"]}, {"name": "David W.

Classes and workshops utilizing ETs as teaching devices are by their nature hands-on and may not lend themselves to traditional exam-based assessments. After all of the effort required to design a new ET, plan an educational experience utilizing the technology, and then implement that plan with students, evaluation is sometimes left as an afterthought.

Feedback on group dynamics has been proven to help with the performance of collaboration. We use sociometric sensors to detect group dynamics and use the data to give real-time feedback to people. We are especially interested in the effect of feedback on distributed collaboration. The goal is to bridge the gap in distributed groups by detecting and communicating social signals. We conducted an initial experiment to test the effects of feedback on brainstorming and problem solving tasks. The results show that real-time feedback changes speaking time and interactivity level of groups. Also in groups with one or more dominant people, the feedback effectively reduced the dynamical difference between co-located and distributed collaboration as well as the behavioral difference between dominant and non-dominant people.

We intend to continue this direction of research by personalizing the visualization by automatically detecting type of meeting and personality.

We apply a Bayesian model which combines collaborative filtering with a feature-based description of tasks and experts to yield a general framework for managing a portfolio of experts. The model learns an embedding of tasks and problems into a latent space in which affinity is measured by the inner product. The model can be trained incrementally and can track non-stationary data, tracking potentially changing expert and task characteristics. The approach allows us to use a principled decision theoretic framework for expert selection, allowing the user to choose a utility function that best suits their objectives. The model component for taking into account the performance feedback data is pluggable, allowing flexibility. Weapply the model to manage a portfolio of algorithms to solve hard combinatorial problems.

The language AC(C) is designed to integrate ASP and CLP. Compared with existing integration of ASP and CSP, AC(C) allows representing user-defined constraints. Such integration provides great power for applications requiring logical reasoning involving constraints, e.g., temporal planning. In AC(C), user-defined and primitive constraints can be solved by a CLP inference engine while the logical reasoning over those constraints and regular logic literals is solved by an ASP inference engine (i.e., solver). My PhD work includes improving the language AC(C), implementing its faster inference engine and investigating how effective the new system can be used to solve a challenging application, temporal planning.", "authors": [{"name": "Forrest Sheng Bao", "ids": ["47708945"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["a0e659786884dd498483e11d2df4e03ae52e93a0", "08e8a7bd1c63975e5eac844ac4d0e3123f92f109", "905e5af7e6e58c72773a1aac18e60a1ae012ed88", "e0f7c81797ec12c616e8dd0c700bcca2462fe335", "5c1414a3d583270850c95c12cbb23e310f76217c", "d32ca85c3dcda89903404ec1ce7a105a01333b16", "1521828f3f04e6d2c93123c4e25fda85f609df99", "8d6c0fef0afd9f7654394a8050ae74faaece5bb1"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/65183e2c6415ef1df487efb1ed9e57aba509d699", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/DC/DC11/paper/download/3552/4049", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/DC/DC11/paper/view/3552"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2408336755", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Instance transfer methods reuse data from the source tasks to augment the training data for the target task. If poorly chosen, this source data may inhibit learning, resulting in negative transfer. The current most widely used algorithm for instance transfer, TrAdaBoost, performs poorly when given irrelevant source data. \n \nWe present a novel task-based boosting technique for instance transfer that selectively chooses the source knowledge to transfer to the target task. Our approach performs boosting at both the instance level and the task level, assigning higher weight to those source tasks that show positive transferability to the target task, and adjusting the weights of individual instances within each source task via AdaBoost. We show that this combination of task- and instance-level boosting significantly improves transfer performance over existing instance transfer algorithms when given a mix of relevant and irrelevant source data, especially for small amounts of data on the target task.", "authors": [{"name": "Eric  Eaton", "ids": ["144020269"]}, {"name": "Marie  desJardins", "ids": ["144980202"]}], "inCitations": ["621e3698536299aedeebaa6748192feed3dd4273", "6c5d314c2f3778f60330817a348bf805cf58cf7b", "0e443ed401707d9bf95aca485709400d6b5eae63", "4fb95cc1a0f978f6be6dabcf2e81ee30f6fb11fc", "c9e99a1ef2f1ea39b6458ac5eb5bca6cb6f368d3", "1ca2306005f67af14422ce440809d49bb8861c30", "434eb0f786335f00b0f3c6d247bc632be004b2ab", "76d82f85ab724c976360b0f7132a78591b093a3d", "9747e18da693c309459ec0fc87de8d773c2150ff", "a2b65334f862d21918ff8673ce66270f34d892ac", "f973e529e17d7a19b5383205ef2b843cf2cda77d", "f44d07ebdcf8f777d7c407088c396e394840e356", "856b6cc96b627a1bcf65132e517b0e27ceda8099", "54342c89666ec542b63157c3e81b9b939d3b60de", "3b2417d0126ab42e0e2ccbca464e80175c0ec514", "a6bce9714ad1d295a4487cae40e796915f5466fe", "15a058cf52ee38d275fa872bdaaa08a57a523f0e", "3dfd7567db3ac58d86d11d0bd677f8712c718fdb", "c21f73c16101f4896999ebc33eb4f94d897e2484", "e8582539f0c1e19c417ce2cc06bf471f99e505fc", "b5d9149ccc27359f8faafadd96a15466987f27b3", "bf9a8336e6f0a5a70f5b28e43008aed5d7b3245b", "1834f7284a9a608bd69f5a2540c525edacceb04e", "bfc99b2e6e771ec195b9ed45becb473bf05a6274", "e6398a2fe4861a89a53c20e34d6ab86fb5d614fb", "c89a046eb1247b0cea755a0bba93042bb40bb90e", "6317fbf932a5ef1820c6669546c55f50d6af45ca", "3ec2dff7b014e1ccdb49ce47425b508e6a6fd3ef", "f87ec652f5e794e92649252b1ef064dd9ce9f248", "364c63ca40f8ef5de80df6c679bfc42a2d1e4454", "bbc86b02ad90dae7b4137d555c6f5e6f9847860c", "a0b8f4039b1075e8237c1651ef2f43c3b2c174f0", "386af3e99cb62eed4cdc64c07c70c5c4f4f5f6f4", "8b06f635c52895b552f6e472ee2b598ab25f1e82", "844fbf4254ada53118a17ac1a2fe4c0c36950e48", "138856c23ba526f8330bcdb7a0b99f2614ad3128", "2df0647f43507d26c6ad8d53df2cf8435ed5db98", "b5a22166fa2bb3eb887845df08906e1fb44a5432", "780fd4ff859e8493bd633d21be8068e6cbc7c043", "ce32c997fb41e31274b0e06be42059ee2ae60af4", "4be22ba18390d1cc7f746610fac57000bd75fe21", "7b3f90f0c28c50f10a078b984eca63b68a3ca4b2", "436d648791490e071bbf51366a8f7085fdcab76e", "e1d5bdafb9c046b3e7f69538ea89286039ca31c5"], "outCitations": ["a3c2887ccb08d98c69ec1c221888f6abbe96b518", "38f4afbc55d3e68d450392a7fce5ef6b3ecc4829", "f198043a866e9187925a8d8db9a55e3bfdd47f2c", "3ffa695aeb4f8f59b2a2008c87c687ab34680ca4", "328f88380422573a4ff9ada1fc5aa9f198a32bc5", "26ae952599aa9ba5815a80356024258247fc2b10", "292ac9816e9149d886894a9426c9b94069948874", "ac4b14dedffde0706a44796364443e21401d9782", "ccf5208521cb8c35f50ee8873df89294b8ed7292", "35582a30685083c62dca992553eec44123be9d07", "47f5682448cdc0b650b54e7f59d22d72f4976c2d", "db8dbe07af7eebc1eed662be268592f00f4882e0", "f7b84424f235e9cfbc3bcd6cb5197fade1ebbac0", "cebbd6e489d03410ff178ffe2efce3451ea28790", "9a9309e056272ff2076f447df8dbc536f46fc466", "884895a86fe15cb9601df4a15a1475c07f28da3c"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ad80337c50258fba5da3dc496715723ce07724e0", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://cs.brynmawr.edu/~eeaton/papers/Eaton2011Selective-Supplement.pdf", "http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~eeaton/papers/Eaton2011Selective-Supplement.pdf", "http://cs.brynmawr.edu/~eeaton/papers/Eaton2011Selective.pdf", "http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~eeaton/papers/Eaton2011Selective.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/download/3752/3915", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/view/3752"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "337-342", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2212983101", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

The production process of these enterprises is usually limited by production techniques and equipments. The quantity of production is also restricted by equipment capacity and security production. In order to lower cost, Process manufacturing enterprises have to carry out profit optimization according to the product price and product sales. Considering the demand of process manufacturing enterprise, we optimize the cost of working procedure and dealing with the intermediate and castoff and put forward a new type process manufacturing optimization model. Combining with a product practice of PVC manufacturing company, we make use of the process manufacturing optimization model to optimize production cost and intermediate and castoff cost of the acetylene production department of the company. It makes the company achieve a bigger profit. The model which the paper puts forward can play an very important role in lowering cost of the process manufacturing enterprise. The paper also provides some new cost analyze methods which haven't been used before for the researchers to be discussed.", "authors": [{"name": "Rui-Yuan  Xu", "ids": ["2148588"]}, {"name": "Hong-Fa  Shi", "ids": ["2795064"]}, {"name": "Shu-Gong  Zhou", "ids": ["3061503"]}], "inCitations": ["1306887760575502072c7c8ab31542b8f479b82e"], "outCitations": ["e4e4f817fcb4944c0d091e94145453c64782be05", "c36991759325bedd19f69264f72d1cbf59a6158c", "74969cada114c2927968739cfd663865cdb31f6c", "8c52d3e1e39292c75b771a1989979dbf4e532ad3", "47490819b6ca2c5c6ff79be87871b8fb7f7a7c30"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4ba992cc0ea55a1ee9aee74ca42e3110e2a86d79", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "5", "journalPages": "2513-2516", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212653", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212653", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2170529566", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

In the context of service delivery, standard lead times are often adopted by the businesses as committable, uniform timescale for fulfilling their services. Existing practice of calculating standard lead times are manual and often erroneous; regardless of the variances of demand and resource across geographical areas and time horizon, service enterprises are confined to single, universal standard lead times. Ill-defined standard lead times have two consequences: if it is too long, it would make service enterprises uncompetitive and drive customers away; if it is too short, it could incur huge compensation bills for delayed or failed services. In order to tackle this problem, we developed a service lead time calculator to work out standard lead time based on projected resource and demand.

Video clustering is important because video resources on the Internet may be duplicate and highly similar. To reduce the use of bandwidth, users would like to fetch only one representative video resource instead of a number of highly similar or duplicated videos. In this paper, we first summarize current research development of video retrieval. Then, we propose a new video clustering method based on a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) trained via a minimization of the Localized Generalization Error (L-GEM). The L-GEM provides estimation on the generalization capability of the RBFNN which helps to cluster news video from different channels with higher accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms RBFNN trained without the L-GEM.", "authors": [{"name": "Wing W. Y.

Current organizational life-cycle models do not adequately consider the impact of propensities (deeply ingrained preferences and patterns of behavior) on organizational culture and evolution. On a global basis, the predominant thinking modes in organizations are driven by senior executives, marketers, financial experts, legal resources, and the engineers and scientists that create our technology-rich world. Each of these groups has, in aggregate, embedded propensities or tendencies that profoundly shape decision-making patterns and overall social dynamics. Dominant propensities can make organizations vulnerable to risks by inhibiting the level of systems thinking and networking necessary to ensure integration within a global socio-ecological context. The spectrum of propensities within an organization shapes the relative resilience of its human and management systems, and ultimately determines organizational effectiveness. This paper proposes a model for organizational evolution that links the role of propensities to adaptability and resilience.

ADP addresses the problem of systems exhibiting a state space which is too large to be enumerated in the memory of a computer. Because of this, approximation schemes are used to generalize estimates over continuous state spaces. Nevertheless, RL still suffers from a lack of scalability to multidimensional continuous state spaces.

Unlike wheeled platforms, which can reasonably easily be expected to carry a payload of computers and batteries, humanoid robots couple a need for complex control over many degrees of freedom with a form where any significant payload complicates the balancing and control problem itself. In the last few years, however, an significant number of options for embedded processing suitable for humanoid robots have appeared (e.g. miniaturized motherboards such as beagle boards), along with ever-smaller and more powerful battery technology. Part of the drive for these embedded hardware breakthroughs has been the increasing demand by consumers for more sophisticated mobile phone applications, and these modern devices now supply much in the way of sensor technology that is also potentially of use to roboticists (e.g. accelerometers, cameras, GPS).

This example also illustrates that the system is not only robust with respect to exogenous disturbances but also capable of handling violation of the environment assumptions.", "authors": [{"name": "Tichakorn  Wongpiromsarn", "ids": ["2166716"]}, {"name": "Ufuk  Topcu", "ids": ["3199888"]}, {"name": "Richard M.

Two drawbacks of this approach are the reliance on the seller being long-lived and the susceptibility to whitewashing. In this paper, we introduce so-called escrow mechanisms that avoid these problems by installing a trusted intermediary which forwards the payment to the seller only if the buyer acknowledges that the good arrived in the promised condition. We address the incentive issues that arise and design an escrow mechanism that is incentive compatible, efficient, interim individually rational and ex ante budget-balanced. In contrast to previous work on trust and reputation, our approach does not rely on knowing the sellers' cost functions or the distribution of buyer valuations.", "authors": [{"name": "Jens  Witkowski", "ids": ["32991114"]}, {"name": "Sven  Seuken", "ids": ["1884044"]}, {"name": "David C.

The furnace temperature image is transformed by Discrete Cosine Transformation and the coefficient matrix Q is obtained, which is adopted as parameters of the furnace temperature image. Based on the linear relationship between the average temperature and coefficient matrix which is obtained by RBF (Radial Basis Function), the average temperature on each sound of stagecoach path has a corresponding coefficient matrix.

In particular, the suppression task studied in Cognitive Science provides an interesting challenge problem for human reasoning based on logic. The work presented in the paper is founded on the recent approach by Stenning and van Lambalgen to model human reasoning by means of logic programs with a specific three-valued completion semantics and a semantic fixpoint operator that yields a least model, as well as abduction. Their approach has been subsequently made more precise and technically accurate by switching to three-valued \u0141ukasiewicz logic. In this paper, we extend this refined approach by abduction. We show that the inclusion of abduction permits to adequately model additional empiric results reported from Cognitive Science. For the arising abductive reasoning tasks we give complexity results. Finally, we outline several open research issues that emerge from the application of logic to model human reasoning.", "authors": [{"name": "Steffen  H\u00f6lldobler", "ids": ["2932627"]}, {"name": "Tobias  Philipp", "ids": ["2074980"]}, {"name": "Christoph  Wernhard", "ids": ["2204814"]}], "inCitations": ["d5b8fec3b8aa12d9cd4ab9075d410504eda7c0a3", "cce113ae2779ee412956025721db9de0029438f4", "7d378d5d4e4b3a06b0ed609aab1e8613c81e6714", "40549c5436f932cc636952f0d3c41311ad7ba6d4", "44244507bc5add96dc77a8f490ae4975e04f4499", "f654a75fcb9e03385ea23df65404d9cb71d0d0f3", "7cb8d3b94604bad77d3dc8129eaa098a3f4d6b3a", "1404a2ca74b6f17d9dbfe05611dc884df70ad1c4", "5e9eee5ba7bfcffcab13da1ad2581f0c68e5df15", "8d2f3432ee990ddf8e92802a92a3b69431e480f2", "29077f68c575725f126426754ea6a17d8ebe2d81", "c47b4fd1bc71383b8438bf68a44f71193e000eed", "4733bf968881c4c82d3805f1c39b66372059f97c", "f9a45caaab1b6d3d777b53053d94181a3bf20cca", "fbdd992e728978f7d3b358a2673069bc87f64804", "f66d92e81c2a3dd06d75ff73ad48aca52e199996", "ecd4c62c5cd7a28b04cd38760a3be38c50c71cec", "656c55a091fc0d4cd7d6697094805edc45293f1e", "187fdd198dc74301c1e1e2694aa17a973cfcd288", "89b32ba0c1c6b2bcd4a394f1098f9d05e4c0df16", "b7affc9a779b2fed0d68139366df0e2fb9575b9a", "212229522be20311c823f486d93d06468f711507", "c1338c448b3283835de371889d40a62ff0aa1d3a"], "outCitations": ["83d07faf9d6358de1eca57f9fc13cdb682ed1306", "520c3f520d53a8b0131e072305bf81b626c2501f", "1c97632fbd266608bb4f44cbe2b64a84af52d281", "76e348e336c31a74dd5d8ea04531ae9073f2cc28", "1ce03bdf54afc8b04f9aa71f92f020877c6902fe", "9c9f5e9c427469c845abba94315be8699f0931e4", "1fd61f73b0dc7d3c9a18bac70cc5927d2150b143", "5ec7cd81a0b4cf798c30a5223342025d509fdba4", "e844cd15b4beda1b9245d30e0bbcb69894e10de9", "62d9a8ce7e451b5d9f2aa163139b417d9cd54847", "6e4ca2c1f0c96287e0a803695adff80e9ba31fa2", "f6c06b286170256b850f954fa5285fbef6bad1f5", "178b20b82c1e5e9612187bf134e2e8d285640cf5", "686e484ec1e6787c784894edcc3a4d35295b14b7"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f0a46c523f08ae4ecd80f399978f0801d181366a", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS11/paper/view/2429", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS11/paper/viewFile/2429/2951", "http://commonsensereasoning.org/2011/papers/Holldobler.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS11/paper/download/2429/2951"], "venue": "AAAI Spring Symposium: Logical Formalizations of Commonsense Reasoning", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2202042191", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

In this paper, we provide a framework to model these uncertainties, and demonstrate that previous strategies perform poorly in such uncertain settings.

However, for many interacting populations, these equations entail complex dynamical behavior and unpredictability, generating such difficulties and problematical situations as illustrated by the 'paradox of the plankton' and the 'paradox of enrichment', for instance. A careful analysis shows that an ecosystem is a fundamentally contextual system, hence any formalism describing such systems should incorporate contextuality from the very beginning. But existing approaches are based on classical physics and probability theory, and introduce contextuality as an external effect, so that they cannot generally explain the main peculiarities of ecosystems. Basing ourselves on a contextual formalism elaborated to study microscopic systems in quantum mechanics and including appropriate nonlinear equations, we construct a generalization of the Lotka-Volterra equations for contextual systems, apply these equations to discuss some paradoxical situations encountered in ecology, and propound alternative solutions to those currently existing in the literature.", "authors": [{"name": "Diederik  Aerts", "ids": ["1767844"]}, {"name": "Marek  Czachor", "ids": ["3278816"]}, {"name": "Sandro  Sozzo", "ids": ["1790582"]}], "inCitations": ["1eaeecc35b3131bef062f8ace4cecfe1717e2fb2", "440b3501e10983f2b46bb955b84be742ec1a611f", "5e97b01bf14cc346e37ca42eea00ba5673348cc2", "0d5a714f459ef9143bf77950fbda4fda6a850a50"], "outCitations": ["d35e0ed3582d927ce96007efe5f9c53978af1994", "00f565e9e3d0312ffff0ad24dcb2424a68e5f0c8", "55b5722e5ce005b599bc25eb1c0b74fa5bb1d98c", "d02cb0d3735946d6be83c19cf56438ae6dcfc60a", "a0ae361d8bde582afb94b6deadfe91fcfbc917cf", "9d96fe6144d3436fff25e617a25d774e8c39f5b5", "2f371014b940dc2bd4737e4ed562cdb58a5f18b7", "20dd61fb0ecfaad6dbcaf73e4ab164df4d47bc80", "a45442a3e160154c95b7f2880783004132de8800", "85f92706987201c96c4a61c522d2ac63638b344f", "61bfb8ac754e7c2e445056f3feff3aaad0bb79dc", "7c3784e7c505e488a0dce4a4f6bf769e2c2ee9c5", "cf67c7c1f24695d419ee40ee3415eef13a4b70c6", "249348ab4d77183879a1e33bd815cbf51fca7122", "e23f16e3dd1d92407c5da16c43708d1d64af2a2e", "6aadda01d40102cc63cc12b91ee028c411146ebc", "26fe9c30d23b4fd06cebd2ef9120cf9328904747", "8820a65423bd3e96a46f6c40006e15c683c816da", "d03989fef2054bb0a432ef5ee7431197d9f3c3f8", "cd149cd2e193cff1f513adb9e2548b2bcfa8b339", "65da272d5f766d60ad06a59dab465267963641ba", "842a7f1600d6a61361c2b7e5c06dc165eedf5c02", "07c1ffe72c76924a4822786c9bbc61877e6be446", "745c020a6e25fc650cc0b2d05518caff5e5864fd", "98838cf9fd7c292adea93c16f004cab8587db213", "58797e6458f2ad46d21c133f09d063e7918b00dc", "20e1b63eb5f78f10499710ab83dddf45dcdc8846", "42832578f5122ac246be539696b5d5eae79ca308", "4c6d1145af3fae2f8da09cae3d11e2d3efb831fb", "c62d492f761e6292b907873d48c1885628fbb111", "a6240e08988fa999d3bd88f3e8d60081a97de93d", "20052e260b8fe5960a6e46266cfaf7d516410edd", "ba584fe4c6d64a36ca0cc4dca97ee2b3100d5e35", "9769ee6af588d8592896ad8b7991b80e5a5ff978", "c71a4aa9e8e83cd7283444d41f4d840a66f6444f", "42eda8d46ca9fb35d9c844baa37b578e24cf20e3", "d59b509a0bfb97652d5573d52cdd034e7913730e", "2f9c8e0be6b6dd762ef06fefe8f74dc23adcc61d", "23f40dcca2bb2da6f3043f339d7356d02e9eba51", "c7b708b66075dccd3422c27ff0e76b9300c2e135", "3495ab293d28cf084d64888fe4358b4526cbdd4a", "00f79b68a8aa513dc27072a8154771d7caa27b0a"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9f6273281d9c932dbce4804b31237b78672dfd78", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FSS/FSS10/paper/download/2265/2687/", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FSS/FSS10/paper/view/2265"], "venue": "AAAI Fall Symposium: Quantum Informatics for Cognitive, Social, and Semantic Processes", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2193050621", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Therefore, video text recognition is crucial to the research in all video indexing and summarization. In the processing of video text recognition, in the extraction step, background in the text rows is removed so only the text pixels are left for recognition. Although many efforts have been made for video text extraction, there are still many research works to do. Text extraction from images remains a challenging problem for character recognition applications, due to complex background, unknown text color, degraded text quality caused by the lossy compression, and different language characteristics. In this paper, we present an efficient approach of text extraction based on multiple frame integration and stroke filter. Firstly text block filtering and integration are used to obtain the clean background and clear text with high contrast for the effective recognition. Secondly the character of the stroke-like structure is adequately considered, the stroke filter is applied to get most step-like edges, and at the same time, the text parts are enhanced well. Lastly the missed text pixels in former steps are recalled by local region growing.", "authors": [{"name": "Li-Jie  Li", "ids": ["49192886"]}, {"name": "Jin  Li", "ids": ["49297724"]}, {"name": "Lei  Wang", "ids": ["46659430"]}], "inCitations": ["e5ceeba304430799f32f9bb7f812994dd333dba9", "f076c6156623c3b7db599ff569dd2c42025111d9", "ead29590ec4d279359283f8a83402a8bc5170842", "8ca93022f949fdc1625196614fabeda8e8c66534", "2c06e75938a22e9b627a05abea44f899f9a07016", "410eba88a7cb735f3cd63850920d77af9083a9a3", "b0110495be9e788ef1cfc43fab0b039f6b31d0da", "6395f4ff3874269f5eb7ba1dfaaa03a98011b9c7", "dbb580dc8afc64b1175e3c90599eed500042c2f6"], "outCitations": ["b5325d494392fc64af825256072a91dfe46eb303", "32771f84d1de986b69b422208fbac76a94717455", "d3aea3119125ff6c2cd6b013bf6600145f13ed83", "23e9a4a9ebdff7fdbf8119241bd62d144a426f31", "b7d91ab0b52cd0b1c90f1120ab2cf7fa89054210", "f565f502ad1acb81c5659b051c04683a34ed138f", "e581b09dd70f70c95571bab6ec02fb58b4edf3da", "f8f5c282dc11937d29183b955dc3e4fbb677571b", "8387d4998f810cd2b60bd81545cb993087bc8788", "53ecdc232d2e640f890c831944761fe5604af033", "f21c375121fbd0007fabc8f8903ad3bed0776303", "e14cf92ecb1589d21324d934b2009451e602d1be", "778a307aa0cf8b2ed273b9089cb9aa8210f49f24", "3224ce96a5d8174a546dcfba0f2a202bed3ded16", "1d4816c612e38dac86f2149af667a5581686cdef", "8668b20cfccaa6375ee21fe41907918ccee9786f", "2de27befbe82f029ebb3babfed4edf0d7a4071fa", "1bd6480a01f4ff1ad13e344f14d6808ba5be82f8", "91517254eb6356b7e26cec7384bf9cc0ec047784", "67c4ed0ef1c978defe1c44868029790aaad21752"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bc94cd2ea67e837dae9c64c2c8a48dd3729dab77", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580492"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "4", "journalPages": "2115-2120", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580492", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580492", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1982874204", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

A few number of parameters are suggested concerning diffusion and infusion values, which are basically elementary forms of information entropy, and multi-dimensional overlap from properties to objects and then from objects back to the properties that define them.

As the field matures, devising principled evaluation methodologies will become increasingly important to ensure continued progress. Because of the complexities of narrative phenomena, as well as the inherent subjectivity of narrative experiences, effectively evaluating intelligent narrative technologies poses significant challenges. In this paper, we present STORYEVAL, an evaluation framework for empirically studying computational models of narrative generation. Drawing on evaluation methodologies from cognitive science, human-computer interaction, and natural language processing, as well as techniques that have begun to emerge in the narrative technologies community, STORYEVAL consists of four complementary tools for evaluating both interactive and non-interactive narrative generation: Narrative Metrics, Cognitive-Affective Studies, Directorcentric Studies, and Extrinsic Narrative Evaluations. We discuss the benefits and limitations of each family of techniques and illustrate their application with example narrative generators drawn from the field.", "authors": [{"name": "Jonathan P.

Our primary goals have been to support learning in complex science domains and facilitate development of metacognitive skills. More recently, we have also employed sequence analysis schemes and hidden Markov model (HMM) methods for assigning context to and deriving aggregated student behavior sequences from activity data.

Case based reasoning(CBR) is very important task in data mining. This paper presents method that protects the privacy by disordered principal component analysis(PCA) on one class data. In order to be ensure the security of the CBR, we first disorder the PCA to select the principal component confusedly. Further we transform the sensitive attribution into principal component space using disordered PCA, thus the sensitive attributes are encrypted and protected. Because the PCA method is disordered, this algorithm is very secure. In addition, PCA can keep the main character of dataset, so the precision change of CBR after encryption can be controlled in a small scope. The experiment show that if we select appropriate parameters, then nearest neighbors of every point may be high consistent.

To overcome this deficiency, we develop a switching adaptive control scheme using only essential qualitative information of the plant to attain asymptotical stability of the adaptive control system for a typical first-order nonlinear system without imposing the mentioned severe assumption. The switching adaptive control system consists of an adaptive VSS controller for coarse control, an adaptive fuzzy controller for fine control, and a hysteresis switching mechanism. An adaptive VSS control scheme is proposed to force the state to enter the universe of discourse in finite time. While the premise variable is within the universe of discourse, an adaptive fuzzy control is proposed to learn the capability to stabilize the plant. At the boundary of the universe of discourse, a hysteresis switching scheme between the two controllers will be proposed. We show that after finite times of switching, the premise variables of the fuzzy system will remain within the universe of discourse and stability of the closed-loop system can be attained by applying Lyapunov direct method.", "authors": [{"name": "Bore-Kuen  Lee", "ids": ["1792381"]}, {"name": "Jui-Lin  Peng", "ids": ["1960348"]}, {"name": "I-Ping  Chang", "ids": ["3071727"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["e19ffa6dcda95ea779d31a0286994c4b5363181c", "37352551fcef6941baf75e821f78def5794e5e63", "7e9d9f9cd7fd529166be4e3fa507597601b3dce4", "34f3cce3aa8b4150c366ccb86be63a04ab78ebe9", "961571343fd23c1c0ed9abe9bbad1a32ab5d6d25", "acfe54fe9469eecfebea4c3cee492e65a5858c12", "0aeb05928a5fd6e32ab1d4d2e035a46697dc82ff", "b45a879189e5c214395077d80889de9b0e088441", "4588f23f322dd4c350b8094cf43a076a356f1e1d", "3b762577770b8a94e46c087d230f779286574260", "18f5b25d974a2ae1902f928bb9c265e5ec2426f4", "589fb102378e4b4e0a797f1a7fd5a5cfcf436f45", "342787afe9b49bb353a940d04b8624e87462c7d6", "e822159ddcc878c93c8c1f28509f6abd40dfa717", "616230a5ff11beb0a43788c4e1b9e8677b5dc81f", "b246191fa680c6c5f115e711251b74c1f8f45ad3"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/811cf0b415713f622007f1be203508f491901c23", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016888"], "venue": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "3", "journalPages": "1162-1167", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016888", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016888", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "magId": "2116295818", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

It allows a player to adapt its strategy in order to better respond to the presumed preferences of his opponents. We introduce a new modeling technique that adaptively balances exploitability and risk reduction. An opponent's strategy is modeled with a set of possible strategies that contain the actual strategy with a high probability. The algorithm is safe as the expected payoff is above the minimax payoff with a high probability, and can exploit the opponents' preferences when sufficient observations have been obtained. We apply them to normal-form games and stochastic games with a finite number of stages. The performance of the proposed approach is first demonstrated on repeated rock-paper-scissors games. Subsequently, the approach is evaluated in a human-robot table-tennis setting where the robot player learns to prepare to return a served ball. By modeling the human players, the robot chooses a forehand, backhand or middle preparation pose before they serve. The learned strategies can exploit the opponent's preferences, leading to a higher rate of successful returns.", "authors": [{"name": "Zhikun  Wang", "ids": ["6920646"]}, {"name": "Abdeslam  Boularias", "ids": ["2209847"]}, {"name": "Katharina  M\u00fclling", "ids": ["1759719"]}, {"name": "Jan  Peters", "ids": ["145197867"]}], "inCitations": ["348239281980f8fe1bc6a93c1d7abf4b7f84341c", "9bf2d6526b480f95fed9b0e0a1125cf07d11e01d", "1e8b9870e947dea8fb42f7c95b13dbd1b97e5797", "47fcc09016c091cdcf18afd3df3835374aac11ae", "de56777b0dd202cb08e1ad091ccfa4db12734a7a", "cff7321c67e77a931b1f092041c4adb1ff1eac16", "c1085652407748042199bcceedd3cd55732a30f4", "363c7e0f0142afa3786ef29d08f88dcd2353233f", "0d085999540ea9c620b7dce75d60b8b09b0c8b62", "6dd9fc6afe7b8dc1d10e10e5f403380839083fd3", "346e2ddf7fd8e5b9d8e651ee9f77f9aa04c700f0", "238d83d96f09b50b083edcdd0e7d3f36491af24f", "bba1c7ada8a83b0222e6838b6541337c7e359a1a", "9fe9f53b0601e9429826128e976767dedcbe4097", "9956f766f762afa20191632ac198cb29dfb45b85", "cbf8903cce11207a3b581ea61cef3d2d813ac0bf", "425d23a2c8de0fca38a4630757e880b96adb9bb1"], "outCitations": ["a973eb892f233acb3093589393181ae633d3a244", "05e4f9007e75d3e426ee2d6414a852e9cca8bcb2", "cb9d8d3afc216a3688e4dc95917ce8c5d234deb8", "7bcb1225984a26dfe1a343b180269c6d62c6ec46", "49e91185bf9bf3e15d28ba53bf71ca2941abcd92", "e1f153c6df86d1ca8ecb9561daddfe7a54f901e7", "8978d7629fd90f0975656412793715961eeeafc7", "a457065043bbccfc5702cb74a0b4c82d64dac5a7", "721c6dbabacf70c0cea30d088f72ed6e1c6457c7", "9aa9ece2499008badf5c2ddf58adef5774d18f66", "295bb6e23e80fa86b2c71a43acde9b36f124e2a1", "5663693c64f4059e02746872447879cc7e028fe6", "15584602fe95b8684c7528fd828c3bcacaa0dc1d"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a916695a84f4cea245405aa855a15fd410c1354c", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/download/3692/4115", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/view/3692", "http://www.damas.ift.ulaval.ca/~boularia/papers/Wang_AAAI_2011.pdf", "https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ab1544/papers/Wang_AAAI_2011.pdf?attredirects=0", "http://robot-learning.de/pmwiki/uploads/Publications/Wang_AAAI_2011.pdf", "http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/files/publications/2011/AAI-2011-Wang.pdf", "http://www.ias.tu-darmstadt.de/uploads/Publications/Wang_AAAI_2011.pdf", "http://is.tuebingen.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/files/publications/2011/AAI-2011-Wang.pdf", "http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abdeslam_Boularias/publication/221604481_Balancing_Safety_and_Exploitability_in_Opponent_Modeling/links/0fcfd50b8c9af67d69000000.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1515-1520", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1508176467", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

In this paper, incremental tensor data by facial synthesis estimating is proposed for face recognition. To make full use of the information of new input person in the tensor framework, facial expression synthesis method is used to estimate the missing tensor data. Then the new tensor is constructed, and the subspace of the new person could be constructed based on the new tensor. Thus, the tensor framework can be used to carry on face analysis of the new person, including face recognition.

The dynamical model is derived based on Euler Lagrange approach. The general form of the robot is also presented. It is noted that the control input of the attitude of robot body originally is the torque exerted by two pairs of Omni wheels to drive the spherical wheel, and it can be substituted with the acceleration of the spherical wheel. In other words, the acceleration of the spherical wheel will seriously affect the attitude of the robot body.

Since articles are presented in various languages, it makes precise queries hard to achieve. In this paper, we propose an automatic theses clustering method based on bilingual and synonymous keyword sets which includes Chinese and English keywords. We also provide a clustering computation to speedup operation. First, the system automatically generates bilingual and synonymous keyword sets, and then based on bilingual and synonymous keyword sets, clustering the theses. The method not only solves the weakness of using digital dictionaries to solve clustering problems, but also makes error problem, the query by bilingual and synonymous keywords, be restricted. The system was implemented by a clustering computation technology to solve traditional documents clustering system's performance problems. Through many computer processes, the system not only can save a lot of time, but also can attain high availability and load balancing effectiveness. Primary experiments prove that the system makes the theses clustering work effectively.", "authors": [{"name": "Chung-Yi  Huang", "ids": ["2061988"]}, {"name": "Rung-Ching  Chen", "ids": ["100704078"]}], "inCitations": ["b66b9146cd9d4f8be7cf5f2171e873085bc78cc9", "251004f64592e389c2967a0690e96367e30f4397"], "outCitations": ["a958b59a9fb54f803b6a62a153f07c6c46bba65b", "45296431bfbd249a8739fae63ed8b8a2a1828780", "fc374e2c6f6ffe71f54dcaf1f501226e59db9387", "15ff3fb913d5653f4e06ce53d5ff8154b8435960", "c66868efdb0a6f5186741794450af0cf15fc33ca", "f040aaab49871251e173a1d52a3fbf9ff1957cc2", "3edd85951067eaf369701022c336cd4f46766ec6", "25c731735a77a0a26589f5ae35d2c09a56edb0f6", "af891f42d6e127040f1deb7ec27f4f43d83155ae", "07f74d2a23248bbdd87792c9de1ae19258c81783", "20baad752daee9d1b6c6fb264418759ff5da29db", "6277f717cd12e90ff1fbae27bb79477f2acf5d61", "4005948d2dea3605e1df5ca42f50581e9dfae1c8", "0518d6ef32dcb712a7702a707abadf216ae49432", "49227f4e423aa58369bbb1339ca97ae41284751d"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9f47b3f5daff7f76193edcb2b33af1060cd2ce58", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "5", "journalPages": "2999-3004", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212598", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212598", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2172016274", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Since intelligent attackers may observe and exploit patterns in the allocation, it is crucial that the allocations be randomized. We cast this problem as an attacker-defender Stackelberg game: the defender's goal is to obtain an optimal mixed strategy for allocating resources. The defender's strategy space is exponential in the number of resources, and the attacker's exponential in the network size. Existing algorithms are therefore useless for all but the smallest networks. \n \nWe present a solution approach based on two key ideas: (i) A polynomial-sized game model obtained via an approximation of the strategy space, solved efficiently using a linear program; (ii) Two efficient techniques that map solutions from the approximate game to the original, with proofs of correctness under certain assumptions.

This paper proposes a different multi-pass coarse-fine opinion mining framework. In this framework, a base classifier firstly coarsely estimates the opinion of sentences. The obtained sentence-, paragraph- and document-level opinions are incorporated in an improved classifier as features to re-estimate the opinion of sentences. The updated opinions are feed back to the classifier for further refining the sentence opinion until the classifier outputs converge. Three base classifiers are incorporated in this coarse-fine opinion mining framework, respectively. Their performances are evaluated on NTCIR-6 and NTCIR-7 opinion analysis dataset. The achieved performance improvements show that the proposed coarse-fine strategy is effective to improve the developed opinion mining classifiers.", "authors": [{"name": "Ruifeng  Xu", "ids": ["1753529"]}, {"name": "Chunyu  Kit", "ids": ["1780916"]}], "inCitations": ["c5671f5253ce87756657759959a4aa4a19941094", "7deb3ddce1904098bc2ed44eac553eafd4399aad", "3861647decc54f82c1bc3c6491b64f519077babb", "ef9e96ef26655fb671b19f797c4a7ac3a563476c", "13b032ce4481b15dcc9fde9a22d4a6c7a76959bc", "b3fa2c51f49ef9582a431bc81f98ed43307ac28c"], "outCitations": ["ce20678cfbffded477f43df156f6ab37f6edc6a0", "96f9e8ee890b4e142dd34dcf93fd52678eecd2b5", "cdcf7cb29f37ac0546961ea8a076075b9cc1f992", "1cff7cc15555c38607016aaba24059e76b160adb", "28633b18c2b3bad80b1edb552146cc200b90f0e7", "5badb0d7e28d9a466ac35561ab7f7eab98f948b9", "cf73c51ee5a0f76c68614c3040dc52f1a9a3757e", "7a2475703797fe51781ab43d10559f2bc306c796", "fc93f3182bb0fda36764de93978dbd71b8128e6f", "505cdc1db319d6e769b173f4e471ed57bffff70a", "3f46b61a7216e5763ffab5d33e06b88c9d490c85", "ea55d078ba065a4cff3787f5d4bd55d98939f682", "42e4765f00de618dc03a4be3dd6f6f41b4bbbeae", "c95055d5f16fcba89bad2e182a6e5a10ddb64367", "12d0353ce8b41b7e5409e5a4a611110aee33c7bc", "5c8d05e27e36ebd64ee43fe1670262cdcc2123ba", "2f82e8c132a3ec7ad68d6152681f7344b92dcd33", "167e1359943b96b9e92ee73db1df69a1f65d731d", "c76ac8a61ad046c0394db869db8f781c6aa62ead", "940c2cbe95e9998876b6d795c09e952ce9d76686"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9975e5a311b787ed444ac71efe6783ec02573c2e", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=07840FE6B1D144AD847FC92A97A3B82E?doi=10.1.1.352.7418&rep=rep1&type=pdf"], "venue": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "6", "journalPages": "3469-3474", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212768", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212768", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2111572010", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Both fields have their own methods and evaluation procedures. In ML, Support Vector Machines and Parzen Windows are well-known methods that can be used for outlier detection. In KDD, the heuristic local-density estimation methods LOF and LOCI are generally considered to be superior outlier-detection methods. Hitherto, the performances of these ML and KDD methods have not been compared. This paper formalizes LOF and LOCI in the ML framework of one-class classification and performs a comparative evaluation of the ML and KDD outlier-detection methods on real-world datasets. Experimental results show that LOF and SVDD are the two best-performing methods. It is concluded that both fields offer outlier-detection methods that are competitive in performance and that bridging the gap between both fields may facilitate the development of outlier-detection methods.", "authors": [{"name": "Jeroen H.

We are interested in the min-imax approval voting rule in which the outcome represents a compromise among the voters, in the sense that the maximum distance between the preference of any voter and the outcome is as small as possible. This voting rule has two main drawbacks. First, computing an outcome that minimizes the maximum distance is computationally hard. Furthermore, any algorithm that always returns such an outcome provides incentives to voters to misreport their true preferences. \n \nIn order to circumvent these drawbacks, we consider approximation algorithms, i.e., algorithms that produce an outcome that approximates the minimax distance for any given instance. Such algorithms can be considered as alternative voting rules. We present a polynomial-time 2-approximation algorithm that uses a natural linear programming relaxation for the underlying optimization problem and deterministically rounds the fractional solution in order to compute the outcome; this result improves upon the previously best known algorithm that has an approximation ratio of 3. We are furthermore interested in approximation algorithms that are resistant to manipulation by (coalitions of) voters, i.e., algorithms that do not motivate voters to misreport their true preferences in order to improve their distance from the outcome.

In this integrated architecture, the neural and non-neural aspects each play major roles, and the depth of the interconnection is revealed for example in the facts that symbolic reasoning intervenes in the process of attractor formation within the HANN, whereas the HANN plays a major role in guiding the individual steps of logical inference and evolutionary program learning processes.", "authors": [{"name": "Ben  Goertzel", "ids": ["1738080"]}, {"name": "Deborah  Duong", "ids": ["145821357"]}], "inCitations": ["b559fa765b694d05a4b994a966222d04a7d8f872", "34b5098b5fc6021059f89247d03ef7e84969b752", "2dc77d2c222e29e83059e4dc1d7205c1ce65e56d", "c89f6b719d56d8d01a6421ed9565812c3d778d18", "1e93c653cfa20d53576af8b3376bacecef258132"], "outCitations": ["8400949bbf0886c1257843c9ef9a892d0e339017", "ba6e187fd14415063368744628a27cfbada87544", "aeceff26e63df1723d36c16c8244c701bc8ec09e", "6e292e0edd01a577dd7709ded60b8515b549b3e9", "42f2a7250f5fc999e0d844e743fa16650544cb61", "3e86b785f94f34b0054f603ba8c9a6c1753b9c21", "67e68e17c851370fe996933af077e364dd05f16e", "84c8d063a85d32085e77b936c04c22abcde28061", "b185742930fd959aaccdfdecdb31641839a787c4", "5659eac141f4c7d58bac40f672fa89efb0b377dc", "f968d89ae1eb3d6c99b9b8c454ed9fbbb0e43a09", "afdd0aa4e4f22640c70f4fb6fd958c2606637a94", "24b747b6b2e274e70929f6e2ffbc979e4c595e2f"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a3f5abf784b72f3972afa0ffc2025588954ef837", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FSS/FSS09/paper/view/871", "https://static.aminer.org/pdf/PDF/000/252/064/combining_architectures_for_temporal_learning_in_neural_symbolic_systems.pdf", "http://goertzel.org/neurosym.pdf", "https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FSS/FSS09/paper/download/871/1282"], "venue": "AAAI Fall Symposium: Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2129297081", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Recently, Tian et al. proposed a new dynamic programming algorithm which computes marginalized posterior probabilities of directed edge features over all the possible structures in O(n3n) time when the number of parents per node is bounded by a constant, where n is the number of variables of interest. However the main drawback of this approach is that deciding a single appropriate threshold for the existence of the directed edge feature is difficult due to the scale difference of the posterior probabilities between the directed edges forming v-structures and the directed edges not forming v-structures. We claim that computing posterior probabilities of both adjacencies and v-structures is necessary and more effective for discovering causal graphical features, since it allows us to find a single appropriate decision threshold for the existence of the feature that we are testing. For efficient computation, we provide a novel dynamic programming algorithm which computes the posterior probabilities of all of n(n-1)/2 adjacency and n(n-12) v-structure features in O(n33n) time.", "authors": [{"name": "Eun Yong Kang", "ids": ["37721964"]}, {"name": "Ilya  Shpitser", "ids": ["2212898"]}, {"name": "Eleazar  Eskin", "ids": ["1709847"]}], "inCitations": ["a29b3ea90eba30b48f3f8a05bf87f0a5335d1f72", "5ea431573abe598c725390b35ea844598151bc39", "722e03da7bade808eddb2c636aac516d65e6679a", "2d5f1d006e39d80d2ef9363ceb00caaca10a23ad"], "outCitations": ["cd9eeddc8cc77254e08fd274849fedaae221da78", "26e4c896e217af8fefef220c16be56be327b8617", "12646fb60d3b56356ee267aa5a80f5c720c108da", "31592816ac2c50ec22bcef38052d9dcc20a9171c", "507c9b4917638d77b0bad5df47edff92f2ff229a", "62064218665ad89f0cb2a44f5b19f7703d9c7e71", "72eff8a5278e69d3256ead09fa7a1063f0eacd29", "5bf6f01402e1648b7d1e6c9200ede6cb1af30123", "17d451204a460a4739c7b1627a128a125f4af120", "cce9f26d9ae328c51b61434b6f5623a2becdf857", "640e79936e620fa3436b4e9f16dbba00b9a26c2a", "1c6356a688a273889fb71bab17973ed10483d97f", "66c138148d9fa3ad9528e91d5924ee1d304257c6"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/70fa99557ed84e418feaf902102111ac72f9849b", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1772", "https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/350577/1/1772-8265-1-PB.pdf", "http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/350577/1/1772-8265-1-PB.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1772/2171"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1175-1180", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1501252031", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Based on prior physical knowledge about the target, the factors can be modeled as parametric functions, and their parameter values benefit further analyses. In this paper, we present a novel factorization method for the composite signals in terms of parametric factor functions. The method optimizes both the factor weights and the parameter values in the factor functions. While the parameter values are simply optimized by gradient descent, we propose L0-regularized non-negative least squares (L0-NNLS) for optimizing the factor weights. In L0-NNLS, both L0 regularization and non-negativity constraint are imposed on the weights in the least squares to enhance the sparsity as much as possible. Since so regularized least squares is NPhard, we propose a stepwise forward/backward optimization to efficiently solve it in an approximated manner. Due to the sparsity by the L0-NNLS, the proposed factorization method can automatically discover the inherent number of factor functions as well as the parametric functions themselves by estimating their parameter values.

In a recently proposed computational model of top-down attention it is possible to simulate the cocktail party problem and make predictions about sensitivity to confounders under different levels of attention. Based on such simulations we expect that under strong top-down attention pattern recognition is improved as the model can compensate for noise and confounders. We next investigate the role of temporal and spectral overlaps and speech intelligibility in humans, and how the presence of a task influences their relation. For this purpose, we perform behavioral experiments inspired by Cherry's classic experiments carried out almost sixty years ago. We make participants listen to a mono signal consisting of two different narratives pronounced by a speech synthesizer under two different conditions. In the first case, participants listen with no specific task, while in the second one they are asked to follow one of the stories. Participants report the words they heard by choosing from a list which also includes terms not present in any of the narratives. We define temporal and spectral overlaps using the ideal binary mask (IBMs) as a gauge. We analyze the correlation between overlaps and the amount of reported words.

Thus, the investigation of the overall customer satisfaction has important managerial implications. The weighted arithmetic mean method and regression method are most often ways of evaluating the overall customer satisfaction. The attributes may be redundant or work well together. We need to select important attributes to evaluate the overall customer satisfaction correctly. A fuzzy measure is a good candidate to do that. This study uses Shannon interaction information as fuzzy measure to study how the joint attributes affect the overall customer satisfaction. First, identify the important attributes that would evaluate the overall customer satisfaction by Shannon interaction information. Then, use them to evaluate the overall customer satisfaction. In this study, four methods (i.e., the weighted arithmetic mean method with all attributes, the regression method with all attributes, the weighted arithmetic mean method with important attributes, and the regression method with important attributes) were used to evaluate the overall customer satisfaction. The results show that the regression method with important attributes method which we proposed to evaluate the overall customer satisfaction is the best among the four methods.", "authors": [{"name": "Shun-Jen  Lai", "ids": ["2943540"]}, {"name": "Ling-Ling  Hsieh", "ids": ["144424964"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["40cf089c6bc6460ef28f2758b0270cf2f54517f5", "dbf77a0b86d8fdef651ad5b7c6d209fc1386b0a5", "5e4cca057f57d79097e434f5da4f1f82736783a7", "7b8b038abf084aa659bbb50bdaca9060c4c748cf", "d878a9e185e572ccd2e827933cbee90722d386a2", "20a3fef2e5c9d432ec9e95e0c819a446cc2741e4", "3d7ad49b9f6a5f961a444581215cfbc2d9b34607", "3458b3289aef1327c1efaebb85f5565509bc5121", "6d12a1d23b21a9b170118a56386552bc5d4727de", "4cfca6a52bc8b2c5b15dd11517580fc9177bf47f", "7dbdb4209626fd92d2436a058663206216036e68", "af6237cb1e07aeb905c06a3c6ef2fcda8e1dcb75", "509caac821c06bebb8a572cf195f8d21b9380f33", "861694fc60b9b28f1ac79a25b1450d1d3d2e8961"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/53f676b845151b00fe441dc60ce3558a619dfe2f", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580668"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "5", "journalPages": "2372-2376", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580668", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580668", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "magId": "2043131518", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Odometry modeling is one of the main approaches to solving the localization problem, the other being a sensor based correspondence solver. Currently few robot positioning systems support calibration of odometry errors in both feature rich indoor and landmark poor outdoor environments. To achieve good performance in various environments, the mobile robot has to be able to learn to localize in unknown environments, and reuse previously computed environment specific localization models. This paper presents a method combining the standard Back-Propagation technique and a feed-forward neural network model for odometry calibration for both synchronous and differential drive mobile robots.

This paper presents two computational methods for estimating social media sentiment which address the challenges associated with Web-based analysis. Each method formulates the task as one of text classification, models the data as a bipartite graph of documents and words, and assumes that only limited prior information is available regarding the sentiment orientation of any of the documents or words of interest. The first algorithm is a semi-supervised sentiment classifier which combines knowledge of the sentiment labels for a few documents and words with information present in unlabeled data, which is abundant online. The second algorithm assumes existence of a set of labeled documents in a domain related to the domain of interest, and leverages these data to estimate sentiment in the target domain. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed methods by showing they outperform several standard methods for the task of inferring the sentiment of online reviews of movies, electronics products, and kitchen appliances. Additionally, we illustrate the potential of the methods for multilingual business informatics through a case study involving estimation of Indonesian public opinion regarding the July 2009 Jakarta hotel bombings.", "authors": [{"name": "Kristin  Glass", "ids": ["1700271"]}, {"name": "Richard  Colbaugh", "ids": ["1729898"]}], "inCitations": ["766ab82ae4a9eadabccfcfcd9d10b6073a78f78d", "91f504dc7dbdf30aee7d8dc008ce4e100ab763f4", "ba610e16b2b8caba2c96ff18ff823dd1af5c2198"], "outCitations": ["5e3b889da8202d4cf304efecaa0a5b4e6cf0b60c", "ec23eb3ad0c5901f12e3dfb7f3dde26ccdedb47a", "93b6740362c3f73fced93bd010064fe2d2053c38", "a25fbcbbae1e8f79c4360d26aa11a3abf1a11972", "eee8bf88a325761142af93a6ccdebb2187715821", "92601923c334294423e727640f9f7043e1d44433", "93a3e56f8f9a74948ffc8a6c94bac878ca17b898", "fa3e8b880c0aae22cae3d12cceff944f1fba2419", "e41ba5dc12c79a64dfa905c0328f95976252ffe0", "d895647b4a80861703851ef55930a2627fe19492", "a69a816893573aaba052d2614c97d4a7a056a3aa", "c3a0bf876366e02341bd84663150f7a8c94c59d3", "3f4d5f68f2546d7f71d4960069dc886b8f86c4a3", "97bdc5522ae46b281389654199d656eb67728a32"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c6dd794dcb6505b8f16beae01f3fcde1ac6fb42e", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS11/paper/download/2414/2914", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS11/paper/viewFile/2414/2914", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS11/paper/view/2414", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS11/paper/viewFile/2414/2914/"], "venue": "AAAI Spring Symposium: AI for Business Agility", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2187137892", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

The effect of uncertain factors such as the different behavior of a human society would count as an intricacy of the issue and would cause some problems for modeling. Level crossroads are one of the important sections in an urban traffic control system and are usually controlled by traffic lights. In this study, an attempt has been made to model the traffic of an important crossroads in Mashhad city using intelligent elements in a multi-agent environment and a large amount of real data. For this purpose, the total traffic behavior at the intersection was first modeled based on the Bayesian networks structures. Then, effective factors have been modeled using the probabilistic causal networks. Results of the evaluation of the model show that this model is able to measure system efficiency according to variances in the crossroads adjustments. Also, this model is cheaper and less time-consuming. On this basis, this modeling can be used for the evaluating and even predicting the efficacy of the traffic control system in the crossroads. The data used in this study have been collected by the SCATS software in Mashhad Traffic Control Center.

CIM introduces a new technique for self-assembling Bayesian Networks that allows only relevant parts of the commonsense database to affect the inference. The Bayesian Network include the activity in the input sentences and the related activities appearing in the commonsense database. They are used to interpret and infer the meaning of the set of sentences input. Without self-assembled networks, only relevant inference is performed, speeding up performance of reasoning with commonsense knowledge. We demonstrate that our system can disambiguate the needs of the user even if they do not state them directly, and do not use keywords. This ability would not be possible without either the use of commonsense or significant training.

Digital image processing techniques are employed to analyze the characteristics of laser speckle images and match them up to achieve laser speckle image identification. Besides the database is built to accelerate the identification process and further enhance its practicability. In terms of building the database, Gabor filter is utilized to enhance the extracted characteristics as well as to generate the feature vectors. The final step is adopting K-means clustering to build the classification model of feature vectors. The process of identifying laser speckle images is described as follows. Through experiments we observed that scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) can extract features of laser speckle images very well.

In adversarial pattern classification, an adversary wants to change the attributes of an instance to let the classifier make a wrong classification to gain utility. But to disguise an instance an adversary has to pay a cost. The adversary will never do this if the cost is higher than the utility. Adversarial classification systems include examples such as biometric personal authentication, intrusion detection in computer networks and spam filtering. Several methods have been proposed to tackle adversarial pattern classification problem using multiple classifiers[6] and randomization[1] methodology. In this paper, we apply the adversarial pattern classification model to KNN classifier. We assume the existence of an adversary in the KNN classifier and add randomization into the KNN classifier. Experiments to simulate the two-player game between classifier and adversary were perform.

The 2nd Queue has some jobs which has high expected execution time. The 3rd Queue has jobs which are part of Meta-Job from Computational Grid. In 1st there is no chance of starvation. But in 2nd Queue there is a chance of starvation. So this algorithm applied Aging technique to preempt the jobs which has low priority. And the 3rd Queue is fully dedicated to execute a part of Meta-Jobs only. So here we maintain multiple job Queues which are effectively separate jobs according to their projected execution time for Local Jobs and for part of Meta-Job. Here we preempt jobs by applying Aging Technique. Here we can avoid unnecessary traffic congestion in networks by comparing Expected Execution Time with Total Time for submitting job(s) and receiving result(s) from node(s).", "authors": [{"name": "M.

Existing studies on periodic patterns mining mainly consider discovering full periodic patterns from an entire time series.

This paper aims to discover the partial periodic pattern in locality of the time series data. The notion of character locality is introduced to divide the time series into variable-length segments. We propose a novel algorithm, called LFPMiner, to find the local frequent periodic patterns in time series data.

However, one of the difficulties radiation oncologists face is targeting moving tumors, such as those in the lung, which can change position during normal respiration. Tumor motion can be determined by directly monitoring tumor position using continuous xray imaging or electromagnetic transponders placed in the tumor that emit a signal. These approaches require potentially unnecessary radiation to the patient or acquisition of expensive technology. Alternatively, one can image the patient intermittently to determine tumor location and external markers placed on the patient\u2019s torso. The external surrogates can then be used to determine an inferential model that would determine the tumor position as a function of external surrogates.

Modeling the evolution of topic discussion reveals how information propagates on Internet and can thus help understand sociological phenomena and improve the performance of applications such as recommendation systems. In this paper, we argue that a user's participation in topic discussions is motivated by either her friends or her own preferences. Inspired by the theory of information flow, we propose dynamic topic discussion models by mining influential relationships between users and individual preferences. Reply relations of users are exploited to construct the fundamental influential social network. The property of discussed topics and time lapse factor are also considered in our modeling. Furthermore, we propose a novel measure called ParticipationRank to rank users according to how important they are in the social network and to what extent they prefer to participate in the discussion of a certain topic. The experiments show our model can simulate the evolution of topic discussions well and predict the tendency of user's participation accurately.", "authors": [{"name": "Hao  Wu", "ids": ["46477167"]}, {"name": "Jiajun  Bu", "ids": ["145383433"]}, {"name": "Chun  Chen", "ids": ["2588203"]}, {"name": "Can  Wang", "ids": ["47074461"]}, {"name": "Guang  Qiu", "ids": ["2448522"]}, {"name": "Lijun  Zhang", "ids": ["39738194"]}, {"name": "Jianfeng  Shen", "ids": ["48416509"]}], "inCitations": ["9ab8e985e760a4a2693530b58f7b758e7ba2a0e9", "be2f7d854d6ad7fbd1e7558abb9265635d1a6f62", "ea385832205cf954dbb949163e4b29437d1d8bbb", "8ee30ff074eaf0542af7b1634f8dba9ec6cd0507", "d1ca99c22f63bba449e9ac8563c8246fe354f9c2", "0bad12ec337d31bf915d7168d95beb9a166ba601", "06d0ba669803817b73f01e0a9c3d8ef56ceb231a", "83da0a8f74933ee2a811a6ea470b1d79b353b4de", "4ff3e6bd1664664d0995403ea7202ae61c5f6a79", "2337d72e8c71c565b63b1090652c1ad2af8de085", "385ab82d54f89f689cbb40c06a3c048ceabd9dcb", "93614f1891d65d5ea14ddc4f47329ac43344195e", "f0ccb0ea9981f1d5e6a1a9b944320dacf8acf1d4", "408f2e0efecdea420cfd0b325c62357e278f318f", "5de25f171cfd569b12d7233d37b451e6ddca0d99", "7455e4e6e350059f7dc0b7f3a28c9a4685e7c62b"], "outCitations": ["2d5a8edc8f90ed4f05d38c61b4f1e3c66c8dc517", "1e0d4986ac7f6dd98424f57b6bc02395edc5b39b", "f198043a866e9187925a8d8db9a55e3bfdd47f2c", "99bdf7a5ae2fe6b8db0b76b699f15ae322284153", "fdc0d56456db9f67945b2037626b23943468d53d", "4b4cd5f217cb3f2078e22b30860364a6d5c73604", "6740ec49173f57a8d64a7894e080ca0e9dcadf8d", "30fa728cb99afaa43f7f2ed291d6e06a85663cca", "d9a19a758635b7281cbe153360b6670ce53dbc5e", "b23e8378990feb106e1453b6213a5efc491c079b", "4f2320627a6db302e55600c368e78100ef8e7975", "5f44df29caf0bcec35ee062e3e78995c1de9c2fe", "b0b08e739aa5a674430c54e4e7e540ce81ea5b2a", "09031aa6d6743bebebc695955cd77c032cd9192f", "10d6778bc45aebcd58d336b4062b935861d2fe8a", "2125cfaa7a42467b1aeab89c35431f94aae39c24", "35cd984c254f3cbe2b054daa0f356d1283c3816d"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c2618d5ece7e77f0ebf4b23555c53891ea526f05", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1834", "https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zlj/pdf/AAAI-2010-Wu.pdf", "http://www-scf.usc.edu/~hwu732/paper/AAAI10_Wu.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1834/2232", "http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Can_Wang/publication/221603877_Modeling_Dynamic_Multi-Topic_Discussions_in_Online_Forums/links/00b7d521eb53e46d75000000.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1455-1460", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "21751669", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

The algorithm, which we call greedy RLS, starts from the empty feature set, and on each iteration adds the feature whose addition provides the best leave-one-out cross-validation performance. Our method is considerably faster than the previously proposed ones, since its time complexity is linear in the number of training examples, the number of features in the original data set, and the desired size of the set of selected features. Therefore, as a side effect we obtain a new training algorithm for learning sparse linear RLS predictors which can be used for large scale learning. This speed is possible due to matrix calculus based short-cuts for leave-one-out and feature addition. We experimentally demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm compared to previously proposed implementations.", "authors": [{"name": "Tapio  Pahikkala", "ids": ["1731090"]}, {"name": "Antti  Airola", "ids": ["1735715"]}, {"name": "Tapio  Salakoski", "ids": ["1680811"]}], "inCitations": ["45550b3742a3a3c15b70ff86cd59f865de9db78d", "3d6a9c47524924b8c21fc51a48cca3424ef274c8", "05a76887cc3f3dfad7f391bfeecc613d6c611b17", "12cd232a0fdfd61d4267ab3caa6019bb226bd811", "2b8c05c2995337e55279acea650f17f2a2e9d9be", "12c62d4827b986a13c749f0d0f29a30681237905", "e6f1d759a49195df36f00f8e24483f901dd00eec", "7f5061219c953dabadbec10c4e4bb562222df29e", "d5d7e65746a7886208f97117f573ccdd414b0717", "f6f813ac0644718ac0cbd6e2ac6f5286c0474f3f", "7b45d057a7f82a0df4eaf7e9aa789b080ca0221c", "1d67065d7a94f1ac29f06038577cedd074161ad6", "5f369a1cc1fedd25b9be3db5e5a76a088fcd2aed", "4c68b937aaaec236d2bb1400d7f0ec06dfed5f4e", "a4f0721fc0499a1f5daee8597683de09a9bce48d", "8624f5a2a0b8c1a00133357aebfa9167aa84b0c6", "f020d26c7170d8cdfa65527396883b34a35dfc86", "3581373ff944ab5178a7c9c374c09f2a4218b0eb", "2438543b3135c6e55f1e9fc820fbc9555424ac66", "2ab499919d4aa5c048c88e8ba646164106da4b31", "1a6199a46dd92210704fa97f24d8b09d3001b943", "c20699bf0cf1ecfcf8061973be684187587ac830", "8f09f65bfffc084b759fd907bf109e5d2491861b", "955fb8082b505b49d056f78685464068f44184e1", "8619d8259bdd1be5255ec1d642e38fb0635bf7d0"], "outCitations": ["9ef23982b11fc3af7a069c66cf0e692560390dc6", "8d6544f27be1d2f4ace94f5474ea0dd73d8910f4", "4213f5467a39ab20a44ea7e08f7c3120dcd2ea17", "e0149f4926373368a0d88f7fb57c5549500fd83a", "f013ba0f9c7c2be70da9be37eb192c5e283c2dfa", "d8384f7ef288d2d5cb267128471c5427fc98b54b", "e5096d6458e71c06e7a78eb7e345383b4af5a2f8", "0394b507da9a7420adf70d5de558fc335db0d2b9", "0fe5e88cb3fc050968bc2060f7a78ca31f5ae7bd", "f7cc43c9dbf6991a91db6314523bec861d087b86", "cccbc1b567569f57d8b9075a1714699985cbc1bf", "d6a32bfe39c8673590fcfa17fb8cef45f7eb1a88", "922b81f11a71aa64cda78914e6356cce89cd4f86", "7a1f3839e59ef2eeeccec95e16707b658ff47b5a", "004888621a4e4cee56b6633338a89aa036cf5ae5", "e5a433764320146b8c8496c4172dec6c32e506bf", "1473110f6c33b483251ade10b79416d3efee2da4", "a3bde8e03218707707c001201af66d62373f7232", "b56f9e273046c4020f1f5dc8f88c3806fb0742df"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/37f77b28f3c997b2add3eb792926a90cbf5ea376", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2010.55", "http://staff.cs.utu.fi/~aatapa/publications/inpPaAiSa10b.full.pdf"], "venue": "2010 Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalName": "2010 Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "325-330", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2010.55", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2010.55", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2162158218", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}
{"id": "79be19860952909f324d8313f880bf981d7ec33a", "title": "A Switching Planner for Combined Task and Observation Planning", "text": "From an automated planning perspective the problem of practical mobile robot control in realistic environments poses many important and contrary challenges. On the one hand, the planning process must be lightweight, robust, and timely. Over the lifetime of the robot it must always respond quickly with new plans that accommodate exogenous events, changing objectives, and the underlying unpredictability of the environment. On the other hand, in order to promote efficient behaviours the planning process must perform computationally expensive reasoning about contingencies and possible revisions of subjective beliefs according to quantitatively modelled uncertainty in acting and sensing. Towards addressing these challenges, we develop a continual planning approach that switches between using a fast satisficing \"classical\" planner, to decide on the overall strategy, and decision-theoretic planning to solve small abstract subproblems where deeper consideration of the sensing model is both practical, and can significantly impact overall performance. We evaluate our approach in large problems from a realistic robot exploration domain.", "authors": [{"name": "Moritz  G\u00f6belbecker", "ids": ["1713618"]}, {"name": "Charles  Gretton", "ids": ["1723510"]}, {"name": "Richard  Dearden", "ids": ["143654598"]}], "inCitations": ["00d63b30e7e8383ea3dd2993499df70a51295d13", "093372f8720a6e0c1017463799a99d281b9db0a7", "f7dfd0bf72ac07b3bb1097f1380ded595bc58e45", "bb3e6558c3113147708911ab25580d246f547a9b", "151f2c6f4bb66f27f2ec93974d9d152676bde299", "8d37feea84cbca3b39a4dd9833f0128ae48cfdcf", "ca5a8227cf24406f85950db1eab57152d5931bc7", "ce808e43af42c095e3dce2dff340e8d6f65f17c2", "75b243e5f4d1c6707bc8219ce0ba70325533f7be", "79c8ad4c841b0e27323ee61b26a2146889354e60", "47762ac025145e7dcab80b752a6987f8e63c9cdf", "32cec6d378b2e8cd4d7ecc71262fa292e0c7797e", "2af6fc12d0c9205df30137ea369ed8535ed753b9", "24098c25ec510d82a69a4494fe3722f02e1f93ff", "be21a4b7f173f2d0e7c9953e291f4ef0e82e2d7f", "6e5a8b04f28f74d4d8ee82dd2115e52fbd00f515", "15e15f727270b5c21adc495d8b26090ba427bb33", "f35c9cad94b40cc8cc745844bca35b18d6bda11d", "2f75ed07256188c51a91626c069758f6459ed1f6", "5328711e89ddcf955e54087b99d5c56dce6bd479", "efe7c2bd728ac655dace133a84be232ca68fb365", "663f35bb88e766d3bff3a1624594e409d24dcec7", "1a04bfb335fee6b14d57e636826bcf27575cf503", "60701f4d6a2d189d403706331ce3b5780650de7f", "78a0e406b4b03d60af44dc529686a15f30b1da37", "15b4bf52c4954456cefacd652c01b27303b49b71", "d0469024619b9fa5a99e3cb2f789b1c27d76e5e0", "ec89db916408d7111367e03392128a152ab3f2f7", "bac1f36073f36f7d8cd4e84e82953082d3de07c9", "42b8a3b7adc5e471689959b0bd61d2dca5fbc07b", "65b6df420b5a5367cf6e051d615e727ff40e4444", "653f0b162caa74b8c1d2a2586c425631f7c00c74", "bda34afc1e0d7589a08c37a2d749967a97671c8b", "1cb274e49ec2c3f954657326f1ebf8ef37e41b5a", "9dfe26c83df3324498edc86d561ac758951ef1a4", "c82cd6698f1a10ec6c2f24cab0475b00751dfe23", "c78b409d59caa0b85d34a63a9c1f720df6e9937b", "feeb5ea82240f7d63e0ecf1ac41a6dae880b82f2", "a4b489fba71e8bdb549f193d1cc363738afa5ed2", "5b03fed2831ac56fca15d033f2cfd584ce9cb04f", "dc0b0cae5d4c930918a837bc19264972f591d094"], "outCitations": ["f115acbd94451f58a5bc5062c1d7e6707e5be1f0", "eb10e1edbfa2ac30b658e8b3e416367a10342e69", "69c80981c105e5d675da98163c875b82e05395c3", "4d45d7b1fc9c470b51feb2afc2f88f31ff7d1295", "fe9182f6d04ad2f9290e7d84b9485abbfacae3b3", "0c0107a2f211bdb889cdede2cbf8b6eaf49e6dbb", "a7041f11be958c72b9b0e49c66ad187001b49a35", "5bd9db47d2be455f2eed8348ed987b8ac7fe4908", "a86bb58173a22c67c97af1f3a3928047e909a425", "05051f38f0110f2cee1307e14145f0628a4441a8", "95654e6f2ac746d0341dd07bf1dce05f0ad3a30a", "ab2af1f206580d49f4eed40e4b61ebf88d93d705", "a92c6942d217a4d113e5af55cbced6d5de977a4d", "4043d5572b0ef2f2c708d206ce6e4bf1842aa68a", "91b677e4c646b3e38b1f81413fa7c646ae147d49", "03fd7ea26a48127e98d311b10da552606e94d28c", "13b28bb8675d1b674b4f89b1acb2eb85941375e0", "3139b1a80229b09e8b8498f0511eba0afe7a805c", "535b3d2d052c4c6d8a7e72e5e7b575aa39bb8b0f", "726970c099d9c68a3bea5e772456460f64a804a7", "5d361c5ac37a016c34051bb15802ee2102d49a80", "a671696bd109b97de56abf3722de3187d4d2e4dd", "555656fe66a06eea17ed01f0d84e5df609667839", "d1e7f0093271d45985ee9d1d68a0a9ec70ef3598", "821229da85e5de4d4b7685398828847c6d671c5b", "2ea6a93199c9227fa0c1c7de13725f918c9be3a4"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/79be19860952909f324d8313f880bf981d7ec33a", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~ki/papers/goebelbecker-etal-aaai11.pdf", "http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~charlesg/aaai11.pdf", "http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~rwd/DISTRIBUTE/IJCAI11_ws_Switching.pdf", "http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~rwd/DISTRIBUTE/AAAI11_Switching.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/download/3708/3986", "http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~charlesg/ijcai-workshop11.pdf", "http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~rwd/DISTRIBUTE/aaai11.pdf", "http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~ki/papers/goebelbecker-etal-dmpouw11.pdf", "http://gki.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/papers/goebelbecker-etal-dmpouw11.pdf", "http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles_Gretton/publication/221606338_A_Switching_Planner_for_Combined_Task_and_Observation_Planning/links/0deec5179b0242fc80000000.pdf", "http://gki.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/papers/goebelbecker-etal-aaai11.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/view/3708"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "964-970", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1579750597", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

We propose to build a link predictor in a co-authorship network where nodes represent researchers and links represent co-authorship. In this method, we use the structure of the constructed graph, and propose to add a semantic approach using abstract information, research titles and the event information to improve the accuracy of the predictor. Secondly, we make use of the fact that researchers tend to work in close knit communities. The knowledge of a pair of researchers lying in the same dense community can be used to improve the accuracy of our predictor further. Finally, we test out hypothesis on the DBLP database in a reasonable time by under-sampling and balancing the data set using decision trees and the SMOTE technique.", "authors": [{"name": "Mrinmaya  Sachan", "ids": ["2790926"]}, {"name": "Ryutaro  Ichise", "ids": ["143758327"]}], "inCitations": ["39d944383239b2dbf55c13a881e86c015e5e01ac", "510cff2928309b062931da2b7157d0937a70b5be", "52a06492542b5262e06fb284cd685f5be4f1e591", "3f8e434373b4a796f858c2d0195149fcf2533c6a", "0ac230eb1d67510c955b994c03aa2bf969935202", "7e860f62e34598ae372e274eb0624f6e61e4f5b3"], "outCitations": ["8dc9d11e3fc229a1b70bb00de72dc15d55848174", "10d6778bc45aebcd58d336b4062b935861d2fe8a", "996dfa43f6982bcbff862276ef80cbca7515985a", "84b115510c7d52cd063acbc907f548a88643001a", "7feb0fc888cd55360949554db032d7d1cba9e947", "413240adfbcb801b5eb186b8a9e67fe77588733c", "4c3bce670150c86905e3c21e0b745a346fb4d068", "30dc6608267a063d1184e54c361191e53d102412", "6d70e92a79c18c3e3b28e3b64168d3266abb15a4", "fc1cf8bde7e7c287575b64d365c797394d7e54eb", "f1d40a639d7f83d373f07b2bf4a96f0313b584d8", "807c1f19047f96083e13614f7ce20f2ac98c239a", "8cb44f06586f609a29d9b496cc752ec01475dffe", "26ae952599aa9ba5815a80356024258247fc2b10", "ecfdfcd1ef21449a01701122745a7be5ba135e7f", "950af9f69ac33bb9f5d279c32290c77ea1714881"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8fc27e93842963f1fe99fd563b9f565d5125c369", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2010 Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing", "journalName": "2010 Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "61-65", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.25", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.25", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1977503607", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}
