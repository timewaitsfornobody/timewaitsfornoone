In its original design, it provided context-sensitive text classification by including 'sparse phrases' in the feature set. Although Sleeping-Experts has the capability to handle a large number of features, the combinatorial explosion of derived features like 'sparse phrases' still leads to substantial ineffectiveness and inefficiency when they are exhaustively examined.

ASSAT and CMODELS are two well-known such systems. They find an answer set from the full models for the completion of the input program, which is (iteratively) augmented with loop formulas. Making use of the fact that, for non-tight programs, during the model generation, a partial assignment may be extensible to a full model but may not grow into any answer set, we propose to add answer set extensibility checking on partial assignments. Furthermore, given a partial assignment, we identify a class of loop formulas that are \"active\" on the assignment. These \"active\" formulas can be used to prune the search space. We also provide an efficient method to generate these formulas. These ideas can be implemented with a moderate modification on SAT solvers. We have developed a new answer set solver SAG on top of the SAT solver MCHAFF. Empirical studies on well-known benchmarks show that in most cases it is faster than the state-of-the-art answer set solvers, often by an order of magnitude. In the few cases when it is not the winner, it is close to the top performer, which shows its robustness.", "authors": [{"name": "Zhijun  Lin", "ids": ["47778660"]}, {"name": "Yuanlin  Zhang", "ids": ["1767044"]}, {"name": "Hector  Hernandez", "ids": ["143750283"]}], "inCitations": ["c1169b6899435e6948dfd98e7004c107a1020326", "231419058dbb5ed1eb24dc54cf41a1bf040680f5", "75a95c8e80fc721c0eed2f00981b4f239b7792ae", "d71861cd9ff9415f26cdcfea4e4aad3467ebac7b", "23cab7672ab4e7d7d100930b67470d985091783c", "ee12fa68f9b6d70b917ba620ea7efc9b56ff58e2", "3beeac4e1fbf1059e73732bb17f0aa216ebcc745", "c3231cfa979358d22a24e9c2205e2609645cb4a8", "e49c82336ff1165d730dca8c5d8e0703323aaaf5", "316dfdec5c10e287f4d0af270d682dee8a5bee25", "99aa7179f7c6012bf266832bcf64f6d820ad88fb", "1c0171acffae4a4f3d00d255f828463b47ea496c", "ec5046e5836d832ccde58cff615fdd64674afaba", "b16311908ce95d61bebfbbde315cdbadaa4ecd59", "03cf19cd3e5a4bb9aedcbbd0d2056c2d02c503f9", "c089740d9b86152f6bbfbd7cbf629c85b2367a7c", "284cb274d638cc1dfa64b50230105d43ef8c0510"], "outCitations": ["feca806dc20be4a72a57b45b9ce7ebfcded08038", "686e484ec1e6787c784894edcc3a4d35295b14b7", "01e70dec1012327589b166ca5832c1dc50288194", "72b048f4aa34f0e46457efcad2a22c5874ef3202", "4cd2c1b9c1089727cffa5dee9c1ca66a90a9c5bf", "7d68775e1ded007981ea881190899d53b68f3f6f", "87af61bf09b17400f525298b6a472757dfd8a60a", "ef593eb28bd836f5bb4ec5e94e4e6d5ab4deb605", "47057555561315a4f018a27ebca21c40901374a2", "aedea7a426a42d38ebad02ccbcfbd40fa8dba82a", "60b7c6404af8f042748731d15f859d3dbea8a177", "785c216a9a27dc84d108c9e49ddcd1df17d57078", "d208e1985fd2b4a5a19a5426daaed380760fb922", "5e48a2c17d96a7f8c882bfc18b942cd6009883ca"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d314197f48b97ed26e64b8a0500c83f5bb122f6d", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2006/AAAI06-015.pdf", "http://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/research/krlab/seminars/afsbass.pdf", "http://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/research/krlab/pdfs/papers/hlz06.pdf", "http://www.cs.ttu.edu/~yzhang/publications/sag.pdf", "http://redwood.cs.ttu.edu/~yuazhang/publications/sag.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2006/aaai06-015.php", "https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2006/AAAI06-015.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "92-97", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1555272910", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

This could make quantum mechanics a more general theory that we had thought.

In this paper, a novel model named Bayes perceptron is proposed to take advantage of the generative and discriminative approaches. This model divides every feature vector into several subvectors, each of which is modeled on Bayes assumption. Then subvectors are combined by inducing a weight parameter vector. After some transforms, the weight parameters is fit discriminatively by a perceptron algorithm. Furthermore, we give detailed theoretical analysis and justification on the convergence and robustness to the inseperable data. As an important byproduct, an approach is discribed to generalize the binary classifier perceptron into multiclass classifer. Experimental evaluations on text classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach is better than both the pure generative and pure discriminative models under different sizes of training sets.", "authors": [{"name": "Jie  Liu", "ids": ["46700321"]}, {"name": "Jiu-Qing  Song", "ids": ["30993307"]}, {"name": "Ya-Lou  Huang", "ids": ["1863931"]}], "inCitations": ["ed0ed730c989ec36ea85043a71c3eddac7dc762e", "6e617df2cc15f06aa67ba922929bce15b0a23abe", "ae34ed771bae7e06cb8298f5fa60148d37e3aaa1", "bdf5068f729eef5ddd3f99f960b39b44403552df"], "outCitations": ["278841ab0cb24c1abcb75e363aeed1fa741c8cc4", "5d11aad09f65431b5d3cb1d85328743c9e53ba96", "842b62ab334def5b425b884fbc2a5bf09e31b3cc", "656859af2ed88cfa23f2bd063c1816a8fc04c47e", "5a7958b418bceb48a315384568091ab1898b1640", "385197d4c02593e2823c71e4f90a0993b703620e", "a574e320d899e7e82e341eb64baef7dfe8a24642", "e45c2420e6dc59ba6d357fb0c996ebf43c861560", "0e0801da1a187d90862cd00ce7f12222ff965ef0", "4f67a122ec3723f08ad5cbefecad119b432b3304", "0ad0d7431ca1b49617e6e5199c0ab5fcec18564f", "90929a6aa901ba958eb4960aeeb594c752e08369", "5194b668c67aa83c037e71599a087f63c98eb713"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4fc08da61b7f223e5c4e52a874ec7c8ba3b43728", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "5", "journalPages": "2767-2772", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370618", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370618", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2131842293", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Such a knowledge base is constituted by two components, called TBox and ABox. The former expresses general knowledge about the concepts and their relationships, whereas the latter describes the state of affairs regarding the instances of concepts. We investigate the case where the update affects only the instance level of the ontology, i.e., the ABox. Building on classical approaches on knowledge base update, our first contribution is to provide a general semantics for instance level update in Description Logics. We then focus on DL-Lite, a specific Description Logic where the basic reasoning tasks are computationally tractable. We show that DL-Lite is closed with respect to instance level update, in the sense that the result of an update is always expressible as a new DL-Lite ABox. Finally we provide an algorithm that computes the result of an update in DL-Lite, and we show that it runs in polynomial time with respect to the size of both the original knowledge base and the

However, as the number of training patterns increases, EFMAM encounters difficulties in hardware realization, because its network architecture becomes larger and larger. Meanwhile its space and time complexity also rapidly increase. The reason consists in the un-economization of empirical kernel map (EKM) vectors in EFMAM. In this paper, we propose an economized EFMAM, called E2FMAM, which first define a criterion to economize EKM vectors, then use the famous genetic algorithms (GAs) to search the optimum. The simulation results show that E2FMAM has less space and time complexity than EFMAM, and a comparable recognition performance to EFMAM in terms of the tolerance to different types and levels of noise or information incompletion. Besides, its insensitivity to image resolution brings us the flexibility in the higher-resolution image recognition problem.", "authors": [{"name": "Min  Wang", "ids": ["144207999"]}, {"name": "Rong  Chu", "ids": ["2009830"]}], "inCitations": ["e591b18daee247957cae387e54e1efcf078c8384", "884a61ee68fdece1aec352852f1af14e16445fd4"], "outCitations": ["24c287d97982216c8f35c8d326dc2ec2d2475f3e", "e599c5a1d73eedb533b07b446a013c3e3b95a6cc", "ae2e70bbb35efb2f00f13e259de3e4efdf33dc6d", "e99b9532d9939af2731c7fcab157ce304d11c5b8", "4a2ed93be1ac27f2e192fc8e8032538f4ee64e85", "4b922315fe980b8ac6d74cc8e2d35c81167a30da", "8ae5609079cf8ae8bbda86c7906ed1250673b20f", "2e62d1345b340d5fda3b092c460264b9543bc4b5", "fc2806a373aefe9ec9fd02e6369fdf9b6a6ff8e4", "5f47158c65d96d94e5ce2e9f66aefd8adf9b82c7", "083a8e4a0a36bb860a9b59ed961bc4e606e66988", "783a5ad227bf98cfae37ca7739bb5214a5ff3b79", "9abf2bc9cb27a92f521e8f3a71148f76dd77d6ea", "684013a1013c272ae661b35ad0610e0ec81562a2"], "year": 2008, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/77e8902249d93f5432d397952f7883ba0afcd886", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "1", "journalPages": "495-500", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620455", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620455", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2142812583", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

The agent population is dynamic and each agent has private information about its value for a sequence of decisions. We introduce a method (\"ironing\") to transform an algorithm for online stochastic optimization into one that is incentive-compatible. Ironing achieves this by canceling decisions that violate a form of monotonicity. The approach is applied to the CONSENSUS algorithm and experimental results in a resource allocation domain show that not many decisions need to be canceled and that the overhead of ironing is manageable.", "authors": [{"name": "David C.

{"id": "38ca8a7c1457cbc9fc1681f3f2d60b5bc45e000e", "title": "SPIDER Attack on a Network of POMDPs: Towards Quality Bounded Solutions", "text": "Distributed Partially Observable Markov Decision Problems (Distributed POMDPs) are a popular approach for modeling multi-agent systems acting in uncertain domains. Given the significant computational complexity of solving distributed POMDPs, one popular approach has focused on approximate solutions. Though this approach provides for efficient computation of solutions, the algorithms within this approach do not provide any guarantees on the quality of the solutions. A second less popular approach has focused on a global optimal result, but at considerable computational cost. This paper overcomes the limitations of both these approaches by providing SPIDER (Search for Policies In Distributed EnviRonments), which provides quality-guaranteed approximations for distributed POMDPs. SPIDER allows us to vary this quality guarantee, thus allowing us to vary solution quality systematically. SPIDER and its enhancements employ heuristic search techniques for finding a joint policy that satisfies the required bound on the quality of the solution.", "authors": [{"name": "Pradeep  Varakantham", "ids": ["1718824"]}, {"name": "Janusz  Marecki", "ids": ["1995313"]}, {"name": "Milind  Tambe", "ids": ["143736701"]}, {"name": "Makoto  Yokoo", "ids": ["144921751"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["d58eb0fcfd9ea793ad12372640cb0201dd9d5ba4", "22dacd78c3f9b182509f67ef99cf1e6143618c2a", "2f6d7cebe0d7110bc7db8d9235adccec510979b7", "d25d644c1df2fe614816348879225826b5a04f00", "5320c1cbfa93b9a8ab8daa2a0e491b18bfe27894", "6c5860809315a4c18abeac7ba95652d642e15fea", "b48cf0bfae4693d408a2fc999a64f5e11189660c", "a1ba74b52f3d481d5f679cb88353633c83fdc443", "32d583ce798d802d43d450991363cd0c43c0a89c", "b9764ed9cf14b439235987dfe65d35bb6ce406ef", "07d88404f24d61a8ea41ee7f688f57ee8f44ac12", "255ab528055d938663ad3274e9437c711e8e5d99", "a3f55604a0a564592adb105da84da58e38940891", "1d2d6b19f4bec8b2390a0f9b004c1db76255eaa3"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/38ca8a7c1457cbc9fc1681f3f2d60b5bc45e000e", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Spring/2007/ss07-02-010.php", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Spring/2007/SS-07-02/SS07-02-010.pdf", "http://teamcore.usc.edu/papers/2007/SPIDER-Symp.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI Spring Symposium: Game Theoretic and Decision Theoretic Agents", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "68-75", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2399354972", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Inspired by this, we previously showed that comparing the response distribution to normal distribution with the same variance gives a good thresholding criterion for detecting salient levels of edginess in images. However, (1) the results were based on comparison with human data, thus, an objective, quantitative performance measure was not taken. Furthermore, (2) why a normal distribution would serve as a good baseline was not investigated in full. In this paper, we first conduct a quantitative analysis of the normal-distribution baseline, using artificial images that closely mimic the statistics of natural images. Since in these artificial images, we can control and obtain the exact saliency information, the performance of the thresholding algorithm can be measured objectively. We then interpret the issue of the normal distribution being an effective baseline for thresholding, under the general concept of suspicious coincidence proposed by Barlow. It turns out that salience defined our way can be understood as a deviation from the unsuspicious baseline. Our results show that the response distribution on white-noise images (where there is no structure, thus zero salience and nothing suspicious) has a near-Gaussian distribution. We then show that the response threshold directly calculated from the response distribution to white-noise images closely matches that of humans, providing further support for the analysis. In sum, our results and analysis show an intimate relationship among subjective perceptual measure of salience, objective measures of salience using normal distributions as a baseline, and the theory of suspicious coincidence.", "authors": [{"name": "Subramonia  Sarma", "ids": ["49472208"]}, {"name": "Yoonsuck  Choe", "ids": ["1744412"]}], "inCitations": ["f9fc366785b3bb7f28d7db071f2053478d013967", "da81c1cfac9abd8763d548eef12b41b624e432e5", "c2e5e07d7c61a75bf28383a059e54c0a9026adac", "c8f4ef20d1a975e02a71b5de3e4c7db60f2fce2e"], "outCitations": ["556767b5a36ed8f7f8183882bde33399b5199328", "7e08e9ad45847e51a3f6e59cd1ba699eee0e4f46", "ea933a5bbb4e0f8868315b8877986a95d35027f3", "5777e5fb5d0c00aa9e6a8edc8893f174486a235d", "4b3dbc36ae4d8171f9a4179001e37299554f1652", "aeb37769d72999bcbfb0582b73607fd8d23f4545", "5faac4d01ce2c09eabb9b025d1b3b16130e6ae00", "d62bcde418144411068d5b09952090962fbc05f6", "4a1a91cdf12c63e66e79321120de2ff510355a21", "f80582efb039253a4f92461bf096e509ec5a3bfe", "0dbf797d5b34f40d16eeadfa7a5b4543c2af2c11", "a793fcb70cbbfbcbf69330593136fce84054f11b", "4f847b4ddc105d73bc78f3e7220e6c1f71a7dfb6", "7a81b88da1d71ca8995fefbfa1718fd322c0d39c", "d1b52e2491b09931ca856ee450a84fe9a885bea8", "85a1725bfd3b4a2d3fe9a7272d66ebf03c016fed"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1d3864e764dac580eaea56a15da21710022e013a", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2006/AAAI06-031.pdf", "http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/choe/ftp/publications/sarma.aaai06.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2006/aaai06-031.php"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "193-198", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "31446837", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

In this paper, we are concerned with communities, which are densely connected sub-graphs in a network, and address two critical issues for finding community structures from large experimental data. First, most existing network clustering methods assume sparse networks and networks with strong community structures. In contrast, we consider sparse and dense networks with weak community structures. We introduce a set of simple operations that capture local neighborhood information of a node to identify weak communities. Second, we consider the issue of automatically determining the most appropriate number of communities, a crucial problem for all clustering methods. This requires to properly evaluate the quality of community structures. Built atop a function for network cluster evaluation by Newman and Girvan, we extend their work to weighted graphs. We have evaluated our methods on many networks of known structures, and applied them to analyze a collaboration network and a genetic network. The results showed that our methods can find superb community structures and correct numbers of communities. Comparing to the existing approaches, our methods performed significantly better on networks with weak community structures and equally well on networks with strong community structures.", "authors": [{"name": "Jianhua  Ruan", "ids": ["23165696"]}, {"name": "Weixiong  Zhang", "ids": ["40097500"]}], "inCitations": ["e463f3faa45886dc8d82346f700970569c78d1e5", "a9aefc1881670ad951ad46bce55bba9d23261fb4", "57de3a956060ef0d556d76182fc023b0b2eaa403", "e14e3a54ecb63882e27ef1c807669bf48b8acd39", "eb488c34ca05d8f6fae72ead0c57577fd951ddd7", "b2623baab9401c9a35d1944df3529d46d7c0f2e6", "8858d077c6771961e1b42e3a5ab871f33b967613", "3e33e65ffa39e76bc3a2be4fa5f976ed329bbdcc", "d62fa5c315256b846865cbbc92149ff87b60f11b", "4f38fc5046f000b8ac0223c1b59004d97c91f92a", "2ca674e84900e3e3ec7bff3392e2ea9ce9b35c24", "df98a0130659f7e0fc689acce50624e82bccf039", "2574a16b47102e87cc26a9cfe52eed414442c48e", "1412637fe041583306440445b2837304e4d261d8", "4e5b1f6246bbd4559c00596821ece99ee99c63be", "2b747165bc855ac413c4e0e91d09fa60b74e12dd", "c23998c7cd08e648c44688c3c88c00f59d2b53e2", "8d36f443e2762f39df8cec6564efe6ab39a13500", "34b5c976ff9afd243989bbd6680191cceb34f670", "3f5fe3ff671b553748c8d5737fc0d728edb6c5cc", "eed5db698d2b70f4485ef0965643fc5cd33d0125"], "outCitations": ["956d43b30629e6be5e8f2c4edb4cea2404598eff", "c02dfd94b11933093c797c362e2f8f6a3b9b8012", "29d4dfae2807a67a2c66c720b4985cb599c4e245", "f30ff56fc607ab1ad1f9dcf17afea7915df446e4", "9a92300b0ecc33f8e55a8ac945a51aaade549013", "753aaa1a02412b5d2d916b5b6197f8bb5a52f59e", "b222526a2990d9073d734e2a1830210ca14cd8bd", "8ff7b7cf3849640b7cfb8f08e2946fd151fed34c", "e6c4925fb114d13a8568f88957c167c928f0c9f1"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bacd00f62e31d533c21f8d623c51d932f9e27f76", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jruan/papers/aaai-06.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2006/aaai06-075.php", "http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~zhang/publications/aaai06.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2006/AAAI06-075.pdf", "http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~zhang/publications/aaai06.pdf", "http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~jruan/papers/aaai-06.pdf", "http://cs.utsa.edu/~jruan/papers/aaai-06.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "470-475", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "15465373", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

In this regard, the most appropriate algorithm for operational text classification is the naive Bayes since it is easy to incrementally update its pre-learned classification model and feature space. Our work mainly focuses on improving naive Bayes classifier through feature weighting strategy. The basic idea is that parameter estimation of naive Bayes can consider the degree of feature importance as well as feature distribution. In addition, we have extended a conventional algorithm for incremental feature update for developing a dynamic feature space in operational environment. Through experiments using the Reuters-21578 and the 20 Newsgroup benchmark collections, we show that the traditional multinomial naive Bayes classifier can be significantly improved by chi2-statistic based feature weighting.", "authors": [{"name": "Han Joon Kim", "ids": ["48206824"]}, {"name": "Jaeyoung  Chang", "ids": ["20233822"]}], "inCitations": ["f9b654dd2eff8ffb0f35bb9407f0c16bfe7926e1", "97d28429c8ceffde4d30f3728e62b4bc725942d7", "745bf9d3af1ca3ea18bb913a2beefe942a9d9928", "746eae7f1e788c76fdc91d347ba490bb2178d13a", "515ec04eb3f5388349dfc38283afa081f4c415a5", "dc4cfedee3d4547088cdb7408fd7962558a5d414", "143ca18ef123f14e4d565c770d1303885f6567ba", "fda43aa25a2e03630a5302e0ef9ca0e33fd1229a", "4bc44375ced0be63c92e551fa66b8de89a3e08b8", "a1d2649489307763516d6643c5cb658c886ec9c4", "55db80ba1c68921175e6666068c42d7ddf17f971", "d9c194ed4e3fc123ef62ddc0e0d8b2056e9ac93a"], "outCitations": ["cdcf7cb29f37ac0546961ea8a076075b9cc1f992", "6b20af22b0734757d9ead382b201a65f9dd637cc", "40212e9474c3ddf3d8c6ffd13dd3211ec9406c49", "b3ca32cafe5343a7602549ae5e51fc2660633cbf", "4d2fcf8af34423bb620dd7c8d756c88b05583c3e", "7d60d55eaaf8a926c4e5de7b9f245a1f61fa2778", "c3ebcef26c22a373b6f26a67934213eb0582804e", "4ee654260505db7da95cc35761dc645d6412e35f", "864d8d57112be5c7c65efcac3da9c932a01bf4fb"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d225f73a80a3b1fc6525108432ecd22dd30b4c59", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "2", "journalPages": "1137-1143", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370315", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370315", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2150836003", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

In this paper, we provide an AO* based algorithm that can deal with durative actions, concurrent execution, over-subscribed goals, and probabilistic outcomes in a unified way. We explore plan optimization by introducing two novel aspects to the model. First, we introduce parallel steps that serve the same goal and increase the probability of success in addition to parallel steps that serve different goals and decrease execution time. Second, we introduce plan steps to terminate concurrent steps that are no longer useful so that resources can be conserved. Our algorithm called CPOAO* (Concurrent, Probabilistic, Oversubscription AO*) can deal with the aforementioned extensions and relies on the AO* framework to reduce the size of the search space using informative heuristic functions.

(Is Cognitive Science Relevant to AI Problems?)", "text": "This paper considers whether or not the internals of NLP systems can be a black box with respect to the modeling of how humans process language in answer to the question \u201cIs cognitive science relevant to AI problems?\u201d. Is it sufficient to model the input/output behavior using computational techniques which bear little resemblance to human language processing or is it necessary to model the internals of human language processing behavior in NLP systems? The basic conclusion is that it is important to look inside the black box of the human language processor and to model that behavior at a lower level of abstraction than input/output behavior. The development of functional NLP systems may actually be facilitated, not hindered, by adoption of cognitive constraints on how humans process language. The relevance of this position for the symposium is considered and some suggestions for moving forward are presented. NLP Systems as a Black Box Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a quintessential AI Hard Problem. For an NLP system to be successful, it must mimic human behavior at the level of input and output. Otherwise, successful communication with humans will not be achieved. Unlike many other AI systems, performing better than humans is not a desirable outcome (although performing as well as expert communicators is). The key question is whether or not human-like input and output can be achieved using computational mechanisms that bear little resemblance to what cognitive science and cognitive psychology tell us is going on inside the head of humans when they process language. Can NLP systems be a cognitive black box (Is cognitive science relevant to AI problems)? To date, research in the development of functional NLP systems has largely adopted the black box approach\u2014 assuming that modeling the \u201cinternals\u201d of human language processing is undesirable, and hopefully, unnecessary. It is undesirable because it would impose severe constraints on the development of functional NLP systems, and, besides, the basics of how humans process language have not been sufficiently worked out to support computational implementation. The NLP problem is too hard for us to make progress if we accept the constraints on human language processing proposed by cognitive science researchers\u2014especially given the many conflicting hypotheses they have put forward\u2014and try to populate the black box with cognitively plausible systems. But there is considerable evidence to suggest that AI researchers ignore the constraints of cognitive science and cognitive psychology at their own peril. The advent of the parallel distributed processing (PDP) strain of connectionism (Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986) was in part the product of cognitive science researchers focused on modeling the \u201cinternals\u201d of human cognitive and perceptual behavior. Connectionist researchers highlighted many of the shortcomings of symbolic AI, arguing that they resulted from an inappropriate cognitive architecture, and proposing alternatives that delved inside the black box of cognition and perception, trying to specify what a cognitive system would be composed of at a level of abstraction somewhere above the neuronal level, but definitely inside the black box. The confrontation between connectionism and symbolic AI has largely subsided, and many of the connectionist claims have been shown to be overstated (cf. Pinker and Prince, 1988), but it seems clear that connectionist models do capture important elements of perception and cognition, particularly lower level phenomena. Many AI researchers are now working to integrate connectionist layers into their hybrid symbolic/subsymbolic systems (Sun and Alexandre, 1997) to capture the symbolic irregularities the connectionist systems revealed and which purely symbolic systems cannot easily model. Within NLP, the problems of noisy input, lexical and grammatical ambiguity and non-literal use of language call out for adoption of techniques explored in connectionist and statistical systems, many of which come out of research in cognitive science. For example, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer & Dumais, 1997), a statistical, data-reduction technique that is being used by psycholinguists to capture the latent (i.e. non-explicit) meaning of words as a multi-dimensional vector, offers hope for solving previously intractable problems in meaning representation\u2014especially the problem of determining similarity of meaning without assuming discrete word senses. If the LSA approach is successful, then an avalanche of NLP research on word sense disambiguation that is based on the identification of discrete word senses will need to be revisited. Psycholinguistically motivated symbolic resources like WordNet\u2014a computational implementation of a large scale mental lexicon\u2014are also being adopted by many AI researchers (Fellbaum, 1998). The primary use of WordNet within the AI community is as a tool for scaling up NLP systems, without necessarily adopting the psycholinguistic principles on which it is based and without making claims of cognitive plausibility in the resulting systems. Interestingly, George Miller, the cognitive scientist leading development of WordNet, laments the fact that WordNet is not being used more extensively by the psycholinguistic community. However, since psycholinguists are not usually concerned with the development of large-scale systems, and since WordNet, like many other computational implementations of cognitive theories, has had to make some admittedly non-psychological choices, it has not had a major impact on this community. As these examples attempt to show, AI researchers have historically paid attention\u2014if somewhat reluctantly\u2014to the major trends in cognitive science and will continue to do so. But AI researchers must adapt the products of cognitive science to their own research agenda\u2014the development of intelligent, functional computer systems. AI researchers are unlikely to spend years of research exploring specific cognitive phenomena. Such research does not lead to the development of functional systems. However, given the complexity of the systems they are building, AI researchers should seek awareness of advances in cognitive science that point the way towards computational implementation of more humanly plausible systems. An awareness of cognitive science research is especially important for the development of functional NLP systems. The search space for possible solutions to the development of NLP systems is huge (perhaps infinite). To date most systems have been searching the part of that space consistent with our basic understanding of computation and symbol manipulation. But if philosophers like Searle (1980) and cognitive scientists like Harnad (1990, 1992) are right, ungrounded symbol systems will only prove suitable for solving a limited range of problems. Ultimately, our symbol systems will need to be grounded if they are to display the full range of human behavior and intelligence. Philosophers like Prinz (2002) and psychologists like Barsalou (1999) and Zwaan (2004) are exploring the implications of the perceptual grounding of symbols, and their research could well have important implications for NLP systems. Their research may open up additional subspaces in the search space for solutions to NLP problems that are ripe with interesting possibilities to be explored. To the extent that research in cognitive science is able to focus the search for solutions on fruitful paths and to prune the search tree by eliminating non-productive branches, it could actually facilitate the development of functional systems. This search argument hinges on the assumption that cognitively implausible systems are unlikely to be able to mimic human input/output behavior in a domain as complex and human centric as language processing. It is the assumption that NLP systems should not be cognitive black boxes (That cognitive science is relevant to AI problems). That we are more likely to be successful in developing NLP systems by modeling the human cognitive behavior inside the box than by applying computational mechanisms that only attempt to mimic input/output behavior. Cognitive and Computational Constraints Having argued for the adoption of cognitive constraints in the development of large-scale functional NLP systems, it must be admitted that there are few successes to date, and very few researchers who are even engaged in this line of research. An obvious way to apply cognitive constraints is to develop NLP systems within a cognitive architecture like ACT-R (Anderson et al., 2004: Anderson and Lebiere, 1998) or Soar (Rosembloom et al., 1993). NL-Soar (Lehman et al., 1995) is one of the very few NLP systems developed in a cognitive architecture. NL-Soar was used in the TacAir-Soar (Laird et al., 1998) project to provide natural language capabilities to synthetic agents which participated as enemy aircraft in a Tactical Air simulation. NL-Soar and TacAir-Soar were among the first successful uses of a cognitive architecture to build functional agents with language capabilities. However, during the course of the TacAir-Soar project, cognitive plausibility was deemphasized in the interest of developing a functional system within the time constraints of the project. Even within a cognitive architecture it is possible to build cognitively implausible systems. The AutoTutor system (Graesser et al., 2001) is another example of an NLP system influenced by cognitive science research. AutoTutor is a intelligent tutor that helps students learn how to solve physics problems. Although AutoTutor is not implemented in a cognitive architecture, it is based on extensive psycholinguistic research in discourse processing (Graesser et al., 2003) and it makes use of LSA to assess the meaning of student responses that cannot be fully processed by the higher level language understanding component. A key feature of AutoTutor is the integration ", "authors": [{"name": "Jerry T.

Many online solutions for this problem make use of simplifying assumptions, such as Gaussian noise models and linear system behaviour and also adopt a filtering strategy which may not use available information optimally. These assumptions allow near real-time inference, while also limiting accuracy and introducing the potential for ill-conditioning and divergence. We consider augmenting a particular real-time estimation method, the extended Kalman filter (EKF), with a more complex, but more highly accurate, inference technique based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology. Conventional MCMC techniques applied to this problem can entail significant and time consuming computation to achieve convergence. To address this, we propose an intelligent bootstrapping process and the use of parallel, communicative chains of different temperatures, commonly referred to as parallel tempering.

This problem was first stated in 1981. Domino portraits have been generated most often using integer linear programming techniques that provide optimal solutions, but these can be slow and do not scale well. We demonstrate a new approach that overcomes these limitations and provides high quality portraits. Our software combines techniques from operations research, artificial intelligence, and computer vision. Starting from a randomly generated template of blank domino shapes, a subsequent optimal placement of dominoes can be achieved in constant time when the problem is viewed as a minimum cost flow. The domino portraits one obtains are good, but not as visually attractive as optimal ones. Combining techniques from computer vision and local search we can improve our portraits to be visually indistinguishable from those generated optimally.", "authors": [{"name": "Hadrien  Cambazard", "ids": ["3270235"]}, {"name": "John  Horan", "ids": ["2127765"]}, {"name": "Eoin  O'Mahony", "ids": ["1401298755"]}, {"name": "Barry  O'Sullivan", "ids": ["1396410265"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["f08251a5ead4a4463c81d005a123e2e11c1ebae6", "55038cd9f3b4a751e6541ed812a3917016147150", "77eb30495093bfe10929e7847d9d04ec41409846", "a1f3a70ef2cc84fbb9a78d0e25c2495b9790adb3", "9a4d69b0b44d06e2f38bb6086618f16263871d4f"], "year": 2008, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4a643362e1bfacfdb11a2b2aa419b2ed002e6d9f", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2008/AAAI08-326.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2008/aaai08-326.php"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1874-1875", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2128968803", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

The method is especially designed for a situation where the points of the trajectories are distributed sparsely and at non-equidistant intervals.

The effectiveness of the method was tested with 12 data sets generated from two benchmark data sets.

Planning with over-subscription problem and preferences is one of the most challenging problems in planning. Inspired by the following two facts, we come up with a method to handle soft goals problem, and it also efficient with classical planning problems. Firstly, using external information has turned out to be a fruitful approach for classical planning; secondly, strategies in incremental planning for ordering and grouping subproblems partitioned by the subgoals of a planning problem have recently draw a lot attention from planning community. In this paper we present an approach to combining incremental planning with control knowledge and this approach can be used to handle soft goals. Our method improved incremental planning using goal agenda with more ordering for atomic goal and grouping subproblems partitioned by the subgoals. We also provide preliminary empirical results in a planner called FFps which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in comparison to the original FF and it can handle soft goals problem.", "authors": [{"name": "Dong-Ning  Rao", "ids": ["10826556"]}, {"name": "Zhi-Hua  Jiang", "ids": ["47653787"]}, {"name": "Yun-Fei  Jiang", "ids": ["3255697"]}], "inCitations": ["056a07393d5b47c7be8b2fd1c51adfb147c99f56"], "outCitations": ["5018a6525d2bf3f5b86ed0efe94905bac74d4623", "7c1f7b4b57b36fcec7199d60added8cc223a7a30", "b68e3bbefc95396bbff7d7ddb9f1bdca344ae468", "e326036236ca385ab759d0b1df8acced43938be3", "16e729fd07e46d975e9ed41920023bddd37f8c52", "016f893ca61506b5382bc85c969c8812c2351cb3", "05716939db5d5fe0eaddec30de0e488692b70ff0", "bf85a310a60d6aea71a20f12081fc789852b2000", "798ca0dec14448ef0cff5a0264613effa988fc83"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/db428f50f254e7cc5dd605215c1cf1f61f79aad4", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "6", "journalPages": "3081-3086", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370677", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370677", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2166028627", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}
{"id": "45b97be001f38de7666d478bc4b7bb62e3e116f2", "title": "A Cognitive Science Based Machine Learning Architecture", "text": "In an attempt to illustrate the application of cognitive science principles to hard AI problems in machine learning we propose the LIDA technology, a cognitive science based architecture capable of more human-like learning. A LIDA based software agent or cognitive robot will be capable of three fundamental, continuously active, humanlike learning mechanisms: 1) perceptual learning, the learning of new objects, categories, relations, etc., 2) episodic learning of events, the what, where, and when, 3) procedural learning, the learning of new actions and action sequences with which to accomplish new tasks. The paper argues for the use of modular components, each specializing in implementing individual facets of human and animal cognition, as a viable approach towards achieving general intelligence. Relevance of Cognitive Science to AI Dating back to Samuel\u2019s checker player (1959), machine learning is among the oldest of the sub-branches of AI with many practitioners and many successes to its credit. Still, after fifty years of effort there are remaining difficulties. Machine learning often requires large, accurate training sets, shows little awareness of what\u2019s known or not known, integrates new knowledge poorly into old, learns only one task at a time, allows little transfer of learned knowledge to new tasks, and is poor at learning from human teachers. Clearly, machine learning presents a number of hard AI problems. Can cognitive science help? In contrast, human learning has solved many of these problems, and is typically continual, quick, efficient, accurate, robust, flexible, and effortless. As an example consider perceptual learning, the learning of new objects, categories, relations, etc. Traditional machine learning approaches such as object detection, classification, clustering, etc, are highly susceptible to the problems raised above. However, perceptual learning in humans and animals seem to have no such restrictions. Perceptual learning in humans occurs incrementally so there is no need for a large training set. Learning and knowledge extraction are achieved simultaneously through a dynamical system that can adapt to changes in the nature of the stimuli perceived in the environment. Additionally, human like learning is based on reinforcement rather than fitting to a dataset or model. Therefore, in addition to learning, humans can also forget. Initially, many associations are made between entities, the ones that are sufficiently reinforced persist, while the ones that aren\u2019t decay. All this suggests a possible heuristic: If you want smart software, copy it after humans. We\u2019ve done just that. The Learning Intelligent Distribution Agent (LIDA) architecture that we propose here was designed to be consistent with what is known from cognitive science and neuroscience. In addition to being a computational architecture, it\u2019s intended to model human cognition. We\u2019ll go on to describe the LIDA architecture and its human-like learning capabilities.", "authors": [{"name": "Sidney K.

However, the TNM is not accurate in prediction, partially due to the fact of deficient staging within and between stages. Based on the availability of large cancer patient datasets, there is a need to expand the TNM. In this paper, we present a general clustering-based approach to accomplish this task of expansion. This approach admits multiple factors. One major advantage of the approach is that patients within each generated group are homogeneous in terms of survival, so that a more accurate prediction of outcome of patients can be made. A demonstration of use of the proposed method is given for breast cancer patients.", "authors": [{"name": "Kai  Xing", "ids": ["145817516"]}, {"name": "Donald  Henson", "ids": ["145894370"]}, {"name": "Dechang  Chen", "ids": ["1750203"]}, {"name": "Li  Sheng", "ids": ["145338788"]}], "inCitations": ["186067b5a215ddf22cbbe2e838e013387bc94a01", "046dd54462b715d2a5bf2fceda2c7ca0578654e5", "e00df144ee5c1fd14350883e2bcb47d8bad3cd1d", "028a254cdd41bce3c51df98f6920d8b1c799e1f5", "1d66a86d4311ee1aefb39ba6c472f0ec589d6f13", "68fd18a9ba19625635a74cf6f8b883f82c5bd314"], "outCitations": ["7b261c11533a4bdcb14f10d840660bd60fc5130a", "4148066e5f8658549bcbb59dda2b6808b2ae16cf", "9b2b8aad32d856ef286a27d9730f6e1df8b46695", "f8d65d3d73bcb4cdc99ab96a049e567b98520e32", "4a20906b6aea4380c0001654072ed6f81cfe48e5", "44d71e0ec9f68d8eb802b9ab1dde8368efeac42e", "6451bf8ef206f86998541e694401fe990de6e48c", "9a8e54e32143cd59bf8fccb35744de12e53802f7"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3b9da4a6ba99dfcb6bf15b38516e480b4943191c", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2007.20", "http://www.ibe.gwu.edu/publications/2007/clustering-ICMLA07.pdf", "http://www.ibe.seas.gwu.edu/publications/2007/clustering-ICMLA07.pdf"], "venue": "Sixth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA 2007)", "journalName": "Sixth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA 2007)", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "541-546", "doi": "10.1109/icmla.2007.20", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/icmla.2007.20", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Algorithms differ by how they represent 3D protein conformations (on-lattice, off-lattice, coarse-grain or fine-grain model), by the energy model they consider, and whether they are heuristic or exact algorithms. This paper presents a local search algorithm to find the native state for the Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) model on the Face Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice; i.e. a self-avoiding walk on the FCC lattice with maximum number of H-H contacts. The algorithm relies on a randomized, structured initialization, a novel fitness function to guide the search, and efficient data structures to obtain self-avoiding walks. Experimental results on benchmark instances show the efficiency and excellent performance of our algorithm, and illustrate the biological pertinence of the FCC lattice.", "authors": [{"name": "Manuel  Cebri\u00e1n", "ids": ["145512647"]}, {"name": "Iv\u00e1n  Dot\u00fa", "ids": ["1795628"]}, {"name": "Pascal Van Hentenryck", "ids": ["8388443"]}, {"name": "Peter  Clote", "ids": ["47199959"]}], "inCitations": ["065476afd458b7b28452a17e15561c099a0b01f1", "280b364f3d975ea17f6b7ee63e9b0d8018b282f6", "ab549e5ce30094a0956203d5ed123d7be1119ca8", "63a44d94b27931ed8ee89c1b077d3d12f4fef946", "4ee381a9e88d16010547c442f8dca256a3973946", "a3d1773ffe68694608948848d6f25f35a9f2a5cf", "696335a185911272a91a43be4b40900bc9d59fb0", "461391749641401231882bc657b9940a6fd0ee61", "49e5e7817f5f820faee188dcdd07bfd8660492db", "61e4175d4d37fb93d5d56a08251f117a5c7cf5b1", "858cc750f6e2d332e883dd1d71f6f2225bb6026e", "3062e70f6858b3993b503318957a0b369e3514fe", "bf1b363e94dbbac243558943340b25beccf0e2e9", "52e2fc3c3a72bd4d61e35a39489a246a6cd484fc", "4f03fa4ec44d714b305569e58efea70c18b60fca", "74c466f8c50fcb65621b5285ed368f1d7c63d519", "e9ab197c1e03fb21fe0df215bfc9e5d93d73ef34", "67a1536ffeeb9fcdcbc4fa9b95b978c2e0e0b855", "824d73fe5b7582dd84ebf39ead59a7da19078cfb", "3cdea150e15e0b3ca760f19ae31d48dc9f28f81d", "b5c2cbeb92bee4cd2a7c9bf7a14746f869abcc90", "49f1a5790eccbdec2ca27931b050e361634fac17", "1ab565e1c2544ee34d3a7da6c1a5d0f8dd245153", "3e80d89b94df7330e29b1733bf7f302a25e5c9dd", "e1fd2da330d899e90886fe10a006d0c15b08ca1e", "9b9622bb0ed986d27fc359c51e1e6b2f36f242b0", "c05604ad060a03d3c3f418e195c0ae6ea08992e1", "06f6bdccf77eb5cff34d99bb7de5b3bae25cb74a", "a922bcfc48e421d669ed654853d0ce3c0a0bb4ea", "7d1e396dd69edcd30534cf39c3dea7fe940c3378", "4e750ba3957858da053b80f9864fd10ee99be489", "7a3f2366cba2097d379ae6e0caee804c088f82c6", "b73f8f55fea2007550427ab7bf103b7156bcd7be", "fc0ac6478cc0746e5a29c42a1073b594afad032b", "d08f8753ba53f87098851a89da0a890cdb4cd166"], "outCitations": ["e3cc3146ce201aa315b93ed5b9991bccc24e62fa", "0c2f9d09aad896f0d0fed1811697e6f8ce693bcf", "1727a56641efbca37e88a7b7d2270373aeaca129", "1f053248e481cac6e446149a9e6fb36aea407196", "936cbf2fe096f047b8d8b4775791fbdd33e25981", "975cf7e516ea4638db734b8e04455b12c1c03c8b", "a40012b141d77ba803ffbc19c6b2830cc93cb33d", "28708fa52d7f7dc07de945954b3cbd5dc4dfc53b", "889ebadc0e40d073e7f3fcd414d8920bec4748d4", "9fe19925d2be0f3681d9f30eeaefbb06c42e206d", "8516841402e10b2b37064ab48888da06cf806ab9", "d270effac4688aedd27fcb5e61d0a249362f8f8c", "760960d0b0bfd672e258bc7aca3ffa31d3f89dc5", "d9adb104a27dd094292beacbc7b75bd459266ab8", "816d165db02a9996e5e33085f5c7eb212d3814e7", "d53b09f2f56f72f9461e5d9d9d2b56b38aa7e915", "689826f096e33d8ad004ff7602c5ad414082f403", "dc33778776a1b0793ff4bb3af10c35fb59d83dcf", "2f387c73d2e468b518c45b5b2017a4e31e6b3adf", "f85d0dd1943c875aaf9dfd401afd17db3002c9d9", "492cbadcc1bb2875209004e6ad93f391d2e6cf9b", "6e6873af36495e0f8ce25d1e89aaecbd6832d635", "b155efe3c66abd34aee764f290b6e816fef342f4", "2736e0f977ea8e704d1c4bff1d8f35c94777d942", "36e091c47b2330acf77f16205ad0d599cb190e82", "57f6a501b9f2be2109bab349b1e0010b6faa78a0", "c103360fd423d53cff45673ee45c6d6a24766817", "8928e94151b5473c72277e150ec2940b07b78d9b", "cb4e6148ee4060634729272d378c55f8c7676d94", "ad0ca3eabc10bff89a3a3d7fa17bdc3ea4c5f098"], "year": 2008, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dd422f8114dfdf1697a472549c0c3a54827249d6", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2008/AAAI08-038.pdf", "http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/clotelab/pub/aaai08ceb.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2008/aaai08-038.php"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "241-246", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2137105118", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

It is fundamental to automatic tracking, planning, and control of real-world stochastic systems such as robots, programs, and autonomous agents. This paper presents a novel sampling-based filtering algorithm.

It does so by sampling deterministic action sequences and then performing exact filtering on those sequences.

By aggregating LDA learning through the boosting framework, this algorithm can deal with complicated binary classification problems, especially problems such as churn prediction with extremely imbalanced dataset. LD-Boosting is efficient since the most discriminative feature is computed in closed form in each iteration, with neither time-consuming numerical optimization nor exhaustive search. Furthermore, because of the computational simplicity of LDA learning, the method is able to utilize huge amount of training samples efficiently. In addition, boosting technique is employed in this algorithm to put heavier penalties on misclassification of the minority class, therefore directly reduces error cases and achieves more precise prediction results. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated by churn prediction experiments on a real bank customer churn data set. The method is found to improve prediction accuracy significantly compared with other algorithms, such as artificial neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines, and classical AdaBoost algorithm.", "authors": [{"name": "Yaya  Xie", "ids": ["34908687"]}, {"name": "Xiu  Li", "ids": ["2693308"]}], "inCitations": ["e4bacc5ebc276da59f1816b5eaec0dc2f2da10ac", "2086f1d470807c8471bc68e60825c68dd67cdde2", "6e95fe79d2194c635bb34e2e599ba32f1c1d50a9", "7cdd5942cd870e1cb7b89617d3f63bb7f8f8ba9c", "c08d4e190264f745a9cf35bf2a4414f5892757e4", "fa121f1afc835e0e6a5454bbf64826c35bd6c626", "f3005cfe0abe512325083dcdffb6139daeee16c8", "f5de27abf25fbd2f58b706a589da98b6a67fb720", "4647cc0dc24ae421f9833bfc002e045f602d0bf9", "2a9f505e1ab148aa3d91810f509ee133272be554", "7ffb50d3f0e9fff17ab0ab4df3a314802b5cf458", "fdf07fec14e7565a3763ee5ff2ea1f9041859755", "fa5c91355383955aa9f8aacf9a14390b8229a899"], "outCitations": ["6905ee3a69178c1e5821c86b9157e8a71670b99f", "664b701a39371c5356754dc72cea1349233c8506", "d9740fb0fc3d857c4c8f9ff6a84aec5e197fe8cb", "21edb18c601385918ea011bc8d948d4b07063e1e", "82b8a5761c12a26076896054ac90c4dbd2c42476", "4cbd3754645c60ad0c6f792c503be14b99ecd1db", "2d2d85fd903223774d456fcd97f5d9ff4f741909", "ed95a8f3a589eef9126de12dbaa314b4ae924a3c", "a3968296f9d11fddc727869cb6d468556de4addb", "ea72827c1daaa243304db0ad177d3ede26dbab2a", "14e53403a0055dbe5faaf9f1f3be96ca0e692a4d", "44adf7405865f5084ed8f5c46cc7cffbe468f46b", "65ba1750f0426c9ffde71bbd6f699a39bb97a49e", "0cebc1e74803e483033a709e8f50bb8832e6f3cc", "3150c7b6c6a33645997f856b273fb6ce0305b735", "e7e96f01cc48e69f028bb68a272399fd4c435933", "68c1bfe375dde46777fe1ac8f3636fb651e3f0f8", "0744559f43c1ad3b3ff0033adc009206ae4f143a", "46a6f1f87f34f3155a6ffd5a99cbde20731d67c6", "68122ad1b50850725e94c8b01112720abd5e99a8"], "year": 2008, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f977515f09ea3f0e0857266ee48d1ec59f7f1172", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "1", "journalPages": "228-233", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620409", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620409", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2150937651", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

In this paper, we present a performance based comparative analysis among different scheduling heuristics for independent task scheduling in Grid. Several existing heuristics were simulated and existing Sufferage algorithm was improved by introduction of Quality of Service (QoS) parameter. Experimental results reveal that there exist certain circumstances where one scheduling technique can outperform others. It is also observed that the Sufferage with QoS does perform well as compared with other heuristics.", "authors": [{"name": "E.U.

Although the rules that govern creating and broadcasting emotional cues are inherently complex, their effectiveness makes them attractive for biological systems. Emotional communication requires very low bandwidth and is generally easy to interpret. Despite the advantages of emotional communication, little or no research has explored which emotional cues are the most effective when used by a robot. To study this question, we introduce an interactive environment in which a person can learn the robot\u2019s emotional responses through interaction. We then present a one player game in which a person attempts to attract the robot\u2019s attention, make it move towards and stay close to the person. We further develop this concept into a two player version, in which the players engage in a Tug of War game, competing for the robot\u2019s heart. We propose our system as a potential test bed for human-robot interaction, both for engineers, and clinical psychologists.", "authors": [{"name": "David G.

In this paper, we design cost-sensitive machine learning algorithms to model this learning and diagnosis process. Medical tests are like attributes in machine learning whose values may be obtained at cost (attribute cost), and misdiagnoses are like misclassifications which may also incur a cost (misclassification cost). We first propose an improved decision tree learning algorithm that minimizes the sum of attribute costs and misclassification costs. Then we design several novel \"test strategies\" that may request to obtain values of unknown attributes at cost (similar to doctors' ordering of medical tests at cost) in order to minimize the total cost for test examples (new patients). We empirically evaluate and compare these test strategies, and show that they are effective and that they outperform previous methods. A case study on heart disease is given.", "authors": [{"name": "Shengli  Sheng", "ids": ["1802015"]}, {"name": "Charles X.

By this way, a record is denoted by only one binary number and so the size of the database is reduced sharply. If the database-encoding algorithm is used into some known modified algorithms, the efficiency will be improved remarkably. At the meantime, a new algorithm, anti-Apriori, which based on the proposed encoding method is introduced either. By using some properties of numbers, the itemsets of the database can be transformed into numerical fields. Different from the Apriori algorithm, the new one discovers the association rules from the largest frequent itemset at first, and then all sub itemset, which are also frequent, will be gained without any farther calculation, and all the other small frequent itemset that must be generated in the Apriori be omitted, and the times of the database scan is also reduced.

It is shown that restricting agent influence over problem dynamics can make the problem easier to solve. Experimental results establish that agent influence correlates with problem difficulty: as the gap between the influence of different agents grows, problems tend to become much easier to solve. The measure thus provides a general-purpose, automatic characterization of decentralized problems, identifying those for which optimal methods are more or less likely to work.

Many text mining researches has been conducted, like text categorization, information retrieval, text clustering. When machine learning methods or statistical models are applied to such a large scale of data, the first step we have to solve is to represent a text document into the way that computers could handle. Traditionally, single words are always employed as features in vector space model, which make up the feature space for all text documents. The single-word based representation is based on the word independence and doesn't consider their relations, which may cause information missing. This paper proposes Wiki-Query segmented features to text classification, in hopes of better using the text information. The experiment results show that a much better F1 value has been achieved than that of classical single-word based text representation. This means that Wikipedia and query segmented feature could better represent a text document.", "authors": [{"name": "Bing  Li", "ids": ["46708529"]}, {"name": "Qing-Cai  Chen", "ids": ["30352489"]}, {"name": "D.S.

Amongst many different optimizations for the pure flooding, the simple epidemic algorithm that emulates the spread of an infection in a crowded population, is one of the promising approaches. Based on the observation that phase transition phenomenon occurs under the relatively realistic ad hoc conditions with modest node mobility, our study show that adapting the packet retransmission probability to the local topology information can greatly enhance the overall performance of on-demand routing protocols for MANETs. The simulation results also exhibit that the adaptive gossip-based flooding offers a reasonable scalability in a relatively large-scale network.", "authors": [{"name": "Zhen-Yu  Liu", "ids": ["46271509"]}, {"name": "M.

The goal is to identify both TF target genes and their binding motifs. Subspace-valued weak learners (formed from an ensemble of different motif finding algorithms) combine candidate motifs as probability weight matrices (PWM), which are then translated into subspaces of a DNA k-mer (string) feature space. Assessing and then integrating highly informative subspaces by machine methods gives more reliable target classification and motif prediction. We compare these target identification methods with probability weight matrix (PWM) rescanning and use of support vector machines on the full k-mer space of the yeast S. cerevisiae.

{"id": "2bcce6cd3e23afb3db7bdaed433fe84b34747554", "title": "A Position Paper: Value of Information for Evidence Detection", "text": "In real-world applications, evidence detection involves evaluating a body of existing information from time-evolving multi-modal data sources. It seems obvious that approaches to evidence detection should consider the relative quality of data sources with respect to the value of information being produced over time. For instance, considering all data sources equally reliable can yield undesirable results. We highlight the distinction between the traditional value of information problem where information is pulled from sources and the value of information for evidence detection problem where information is pushed from the sources. We further comment on how this distinction enables new qualities of information to be measured and characterized. In this paper, we address the following questions: What should value of information mean for evidence detection? What are the components needed to characterize value of information? How should these components be measured and combined to compute a value for information? Finally, how should value of information be used in evidence detection? We develop a framework for implementing value of information for evidence detection and present the results of a preliminary feasibility study. Introduction and Background The sheer size and complexity of data sets in real-world applications have prompted many efforts on management and analysis of large complex networks. These networks store multi-source data with multi-modal and multi-relational properties in a human-understandable way. One of the associated challenges is to find evidence in support of or against a particular hypothesis. It is common to try to detect patterns in the data and use these patterns to perform inference or update beliefs in a set of hypotheses. The published literature is full of algorithms for pattern matching, pattern mining, link analysis, and many others on such networks (Gallagher 2006; Getoor & Diehl 2005; Washio & Motoda 2003). A logical next step is to take these algorithms further and use their patterns/results as evidence. In this paper, we argue that any approach to evidence detection should consider the value of information (VOI) for the output of the data sources. Without such measurement, all \u2217Work performed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Copyright c \u00a9 2006, American Association for Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. sources and their data are considered \u201cequal.\u201d This assumption is clearly false. For instance, using patterns that were generated from an unreliable data source is clearly not desirable. Our proposed VOI framework enables evaluation of detected patterns based on their qualities. Throughout the remainder of this paper, we highlight related work from a number of fields. We provide an idealized definition of VOI as well as a technique for estimating it. We conclude by presenting some of the results obtained in our preliminary feasibility study and discussing the future directions for continuing this research. The problem of determining VOI is well-studied in various fields dating back to the 1940s. All existing approaches solve a variant of the following problem. Given a set of sources, which is the best (or best set) to obtain an observation (or a set of observations) from? In other words, an agent must determine the optimal \u201cactivation schedule\u201d for the sources of information to maximize (or minimize) some objective. There are a number of approaches to solving this problem, based mostly on decision theory and/or information theory. However, measuring VOI for evidence detection differs from previous work in several ways. First, prior work typically makes inherent assumptions about reliability of information (Horvitz & Rutledge 1991; McCarthy 1956; Shannon 1948). In particular, the traditional approaches of information and decision theory assume sources to be fully reliable. Data for evidence detection is often not fully reliable or even relevant. It originates from multi-modal sources \u2013 each with varying characteristics that can change as the world evolves. Second, previous work typically characterizes the value of querying an information source which is a pull problem (as data is pulled from sources) (Heckerman, Horvitz, & Middleton 1993; Zhang, Ji, & Looney 2002). For the purpose of evidence detection, we are interested in understanding how to interpret data that we have already obtained or has been pushed to us. To understand this distinction, consider the following situation. You are buying a new car from a company that is known to produce a high quality product. Unfortunately, the company has redesigned the car for this year and you do not know if it is up to the usual standards. There are two ways you can proceed. One is to proceed under the assumption that the company\u2019s reputation is sufficient and they will likely not produce a bad car. Alternatively, you can test drive the car and determine if the product is consistent with what you know about the company. The first case, when you make the decision solely based on reputation, is an example of a pull problem. The second case, when you decide after test driving the vehicle, is an example of a push problem. The key distinction is whether the value of what the source (or company) produces is determined prior to (pull) or after (push) inspection of the product (or information). Our position is that in detecting evidence within a body of existing information, push methods are what need to be utilized. To use the methods developed for the pull problem, where inspection of the current information does not occur when evaluating quality or value, imposes an artificial handicap on the detection of evidence. The pull approach is warranted when there is a cost for obtaining information as is typically assumed in decision theory. Since evidence is available without cost, we can exploit the opportunity to inspect the current information and develop a measure for VOI more attune to shifts in information quality. Third, we found little work that attempted to learn VOI and/or its components across multiple sources over time. Generally speaking, the majority of work in this area comes from the Information Fusion community (Rogova & Nimier 2004). The goal in information fusion is to combine multiple sources of information into one coherent representation. Often, the pre-fusion information is missing values, pertains to disjoint concepts, or may be unreliable. All of these as well as other properties of the pre-fusion information must be taken into account when designing a fusion operator. Moreover existing approaches in the fusion community, such as Delmotte, Dubois, and Borne\u2019s (1996), generally do not involve learning to characterize the quality of data. In this work, it is noted that the quality of knowledge produced by fusion is influenced by adequacy of the data, quality of the uncertainty model, and quality of the prior knowledge. Much of this work has focused on the improvement of an uncertainty model and has completely ignored the reliability of information. When it is considered, two measures of reliability are discussed: 1) The relative stability of the first order uncertainty; 2) The accuracy of the beliefs. It is assumed that the fusion operator will not introduce any residual uncertainty that is not due to the data itself. A fair amount of research has been devoted to the incorporation of reliability into fusion rules. In this research, the reliability measure comes in one of three forms: 1) It is encoded by external sources (e.g. context or an expert); 2) It is learned using training data; 3) It is constructed based on agreement of sources or consensus (Delmotte, Dubois, & Borne 1996; Parra-Loera, Thompson, & Salvi 1991). It is not, however, estimated prior to fusion. Historically, consensus models of reliability have taken one of the following two forms: 1) A degree of deviation between measurements of each source and the fusion result (e.g. posterior belief); 2) A measure of \u201cinner trust\u201d based on a pairwise degree of \u201clikeliness\u201d of agreement (or consensus) between sources. While this work is interesting and in some cases can improve inference performance, there is a notable problem with consensus measures of reliability. Specifically, lack of consensus is sufficient for low reliability but not necessary. Further, for VOI to Figure 1: VOI Framework for Evidence Detection be useful for evidence detection, it must be computed prior to fusion\u2013and not as a function of its output. Measuring VOI for evidence enables a solution to the problem of detecting information (i.e. evidence) with the highest qualitative value to either confirm a true hypothesis or disconfirm a false hypothesis. VOI for evidence detection should: 1) capture information from possibly unreliable sources; 2) characterize the value of a body of existing information (a push problem); and 3) be tailored to improve inference and allow data triage. Figure 1 depicts our framework for VOI in evidence detection. At the top of the Figure there are a set of sources that are pushing reports (or information). The different icons in the sources are intended to represent the multi-modal data. The reports they generate evolve over time as the environment evolves. In the center of the Figure, there is an f inside a circle. To the left is a representation of a set of beliefs (i.e. prior knowledge or knowledge obtained earlier) that are evolving over time and to the right are the set of hypotheses that are (possibly) evolving over time. The f represents the combination of information, beliefs, and hypothesis into a quality metric. Note that this is not the same as fusion. In the fusion framework, the information from the sources would be combined to produce \u201cmanipulated\u201d data (we return to this concept later). In our VOI framework, the information from the sources is combined to produce a measure of quality. This measure of quality can be used", "authors": [{"name": "David L.

Usually the latter achieves a higher compression ratio than the former. However, to develop a lossy compression method, we have to know, for a given type of data, what information can be discarded without significant degradation of the data quality. A usual way to obtain such knowledge is by experiments. For example, from user statistics, we know that human eyes are insensitive to some frequency channels of the light signal. Thus we can compress image data by decomposing them into various frequency channels using a DCT transformation, and neglect the coefficients of the channels that are insensitive to human eyes. However, it is complex and expensive for human analysts to conduct and study so many experiments. Alternatively, we propose to learn the knowledge automatically by using machine learning techniques. Under the framework of Bayesian learning, general prior knowledge is expressed by designing the statistical models, and the refined posterior knowledge can be learned automatically from data to be compressed. More particularly, we consider the compression of some input data as learning a statistical model from the data, and consider the restoration of data as sampling from the learned model. Therefore, only the estimated model parameters are saved as the compressed version. A key to this idea is to design a statistical model that can accurately describe the data (so it is possible to recover the data precisely) and is defined by a compact set of parameters (so to achieve high compression ratio). For a general application of compressing sequential data, we designed the Variable-length Hidden Markov Model (VLHMM), whose learning algorithm automatically learns a minimal set of parameters (by optimizing a MinimumEntropy criterion) that accurately models the sequential data (by optimizing a Maximum-Likelihood criterion).

The search results of these queries are combined together and returned to the searcher in a traditional sequential order. Nevertheless, searchers still frequently miss desired information, because the traditional search result output interface cannot capture the internal structures of medical search results. This paper presents a new, intelligent search result output interface devoted to intelligent medical search. The new output interface automatically offers searchers what they want instead of waiting until they ask explicitly.

In this paper we investigate the speedup of the diagnosis process by exploiting the hierarchy/locality as is typically present in well-engineered systems. The approach comprises a compile-time and a run-time step. In the first step, a hierarchical CNF representation of the system is compiled to hierarchical DNF of adjustable hierarchical depth. In the second step, the diagnoses are computed from the hierarchical DNF and the actual observations. Our hierarchical algorithm, while sound and complete, allows large models to be diagnosed, where compiletime investment directly translates to run-time speedup. The benefits of our approach are illustrated by using weak-fault models of real-world systems, including the ISCAS-85 combinatorial circuits. Even for these non-optimally partitioned problems the speedup compared to traditional approaches ranges in the hundreds.", "authors": [{"name": "Alexander  Feldman", "ids": ["46904802"]}, {"name": "Arjan J.

Unfortunately, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem shows that when there are three or more candidates, all reasonable voting rules are manipulable (in the sense that there exist situations in which a voter would benefit from reporting its preferences insincerely). To circumvent this impossibility result, recent research has investigated whether it is possible to make finding a beneficial manipulation computationally hard. This approach has had some limited success, exhibiting rules under which the problem of finding a beneficial manipulation is NP-hard, #P-hard, or even PSPACE-hard. Thus, under these rules, it is unlikely that a computationally efficient algorithm can be constructed that always finds a beneficial manipulation (when it exists). However, this still does not preclude the existence of an efficient algorithm that often finds a successful manipulation (when it exists). There have been attempts to design a rule under which finding a beneficial manipulation is usually hard, but they have failed. To explain this failure, in this paper, we show that it is in fact impossible to design such a rule, if the rule is also required to satisfy another property: a large fraction of the manipulable instances are both weakly monotone, and allow the manipulators to make either of exactly two candidates win. We argue why one should expect voting rules to have this property, and show experimentally that common voting rules clearly satisfy it. We also discuss approaches for potentially circumventing this impossibility result.", "authors": [{"name": "Vincent  Conitzer", "ids": ["1749906"]}, {"name": "Tuomas  Sandholm", "ids":

Recent research in this domain has focused on the application of general-purpose evolutionary algorithms to match specific types of target sounds. However, it is difficult to establish whether success or failure of a particular match is due to the inefficiency of the optimisation engine, or the limitations of the matching synthesiser. In this paper the distinction between optimiser inefficiency and synthesiser limitations is elucidated with a contrived target test methodology that enables the performance of different optimisation techniques to be measured and compared. The methodology is applied to a Frequency Modulation synthesiser, in order to compare the performance of different Evolution Strategy-based algorithms. The algorithm producing the best results with contrived targets is then used to match a non-contrived acoustic instrument tone.", "authors": [{"name": "Thomas J.

Many interesting queries reduce to reasoning about the role of objects. Being able to talk about the existence of parts and sub-parts and the relationships between these parts, allows for probability distributions over complex descriptions. Rather than trying to define a new language, this paper shows how the integration of multiple objects, ontologies and roles can be achieved cleanly. This solves two main problems: reasoning about existence and identity while preserving the clarity principle that specifies that probabilities must be over well defined propositions, and the correspondence problem that means that we don't need to search over all possible correspondences between objects said to exist and things in the world.", "authors": [{"name": "David  Poole", "ids": ["143715817"]}], "inCitations": ["c4ded408f14700c0070b320f0564d1221ca8419d", "eaca26c57d1ac020764ace9b642dc16851ef871d", "ff81ed2ee2d5a67a95d371240f4ba8d01c0ff6da", "7e4fc031a832ead3087cbd449b8a136e23eb3950", "3ae7e01ddc70e47f6bd57bd437847ec8e3613735", "8274fa747d6affbe9cd6edd6684d1722a84ff6b6", "160104dde3e30bba5730a562784e53cd5463b8d9", "27fb24031391e121e503dfea9c311b87f3455895", "e3d82031c3e78340e94c94ca4629ddd69bd2570f", "6d296b269991f165b650a6360254a7413e966d27", "eca39cdc5b10ccb7eb1c3dd7cd79d214b3b0feea", "49490378ad40fadbffe1e81c8b169c83a067164c", "2868ac871287ee4917ac360e3d8990e9c4734575", "b8263ef3e0bbb237a7227180d2a49cf786566a7d", "276579dd0d88a0046f58586db0047fe7e71c3571", "6c6ed49d5fc2c07f41bb907a131905ddd1d3fdce", "06996e180cab25c3644387bd93fb6bad6cb76556", "d949bb985e8aecf55d14db780f8e5de568184f19", "32b6d343565fa46929c232e371a8396fcd6adfe4", "33f510c0a09e2f9a72f3a984dc8578147cf5387e", "8ecf1e58cb667162030396f84f06a8bcfdbc526e", "6931fb40ac293ac8c83eff3f9f57b1083d1d92e2", "ef9c7f30cdbd266e94ea9e83b55cfdf0786d2b40"], "outCitations": ["25308818aa94ffb3a9809540b530f6e8c7bfb83c", "1362c5764e98e367c0afc221bcd5823e90494bde", "3b54cb0af7601b84bf5db370c5379e164cdbb7eb", "cbc74e51148a5b27819384779c1a141c19597afb", "16af2a2901ad67741a3d60b71f1e484ea8fa3530", "eff6287b55d680f3daa1be4effdf063999b3e0d1", "e64cb886120ead3a7f198273f8e24bc508d45959", "d65d7507526c02778f3edb6bb775aa613e7377ba", "5a54ab8ffeab9552642865faf6fa5dcd4ff15929", "59735d8798db201970434caecedf12ed4a9dc7dd"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fb26d5c03da5d78d6748f421f942855baccaeea7", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.cs.ubc.ca/spider/poole/papers/AAAI07-Poole.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2007/aaai07-201.php", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2007/AAAI07-201.pdf", "http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~poole/papers/AAAI07-Poole.pdf", "http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~poole/talks/aaai2007Poole.pdf", "http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~poole/papers/AAAI07-Poole.pdf", "http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~poole/talks/aaai2007Poole.pdf", "https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2007/AAAI07-201.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1271-1277", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "158290890", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

{"id": "ac9302f6af8bd0c09794c6188a5d5f12f21075a0", "title": "Privatizing Constraint Optimization", "text": "My thesis will contribute to the fields of constraint processing and multiagent systems by proposing novel schemes for achieving privacy in constraint optimization as well as new ways of analyzing and understanding the privacy properties of constraint optimization algorithms. Motivation: It is my belief that there are many domains within constraint processing that motivate the need for more private algorithms and that this work will be broadly applicable. However, I would like to present two particular salient examples in the following paragraphs. One domain that naturally motivates privacy preserving constraint optimization algorithms is scheduling. In this domain, a number of agents, including, say, Sally in Human Resources, wish to schedule events subject to their individual constraints. They wish to keep these constraints private. Sally\u2019s calendar, for one, contains the intersection of multiple professional endeavors as well as items relevant to her personal life. In this case, the agents involved\u2014including Sally\u2014want a solution that will optimize the global social welfare, but that doesn\u2019t mean they want everyone to know how Sally\u2019s preference for attending cancer support group meetings led to that result. As another motivating example, consider the problem of resource allocation. Imagine several government, corporate and nonprofit groups that come together to help with some disaster relief effort. They all wish to contribute the resources that will lead to the optimal end, however, they are mutually distrustful in most of their other endeavors and don\u2019t want the other entities to know the details of their individual constraints. Background: Initially, all constraint processing algorithms were centralized. All constraints were communicated to a central server that then could learn everything about everyone. Concerns about privacy led to the development of distributed constraint satisfaction and optimization algorithms [12, 6]. In these algorithms, each agent owns its own constraints and passes messages as necessary to other agents to collaboratively compute the solution. Since the information was distributed among many agents, these algorithms were thought to be more private.

The natural language multiagent mental simulator NL_MAMS, which operates in this world, is introduced, and the rehabilitation methodology is outlined. Introduction: enabling autistic reasoning with intention and belief Recent psychological studies have revealed that autistic children can neither reason properly about mental states nor understand emotions (Perner 1991; Pilowsky at al 2000). Autism is characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, combined with repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, and affects up to 1% of school-aged children. Frequently, autistic children do not understand intentions of others. Being able to provide adequate answers to the questions \u201care you hungry?\u201d, \u201cdo you like this toy?\u201d, most autistic children do not react to questions like \u201cam I hungry?\u201d, \u201cwould he want this toy?\u2019. Autistic children need to be explicitly taught that other people have intentions. The theory of mind account, which is most relevant to teaching understanding of intentions of others, refers to the ability to infer and understand what oneself and others are thinking (knowing, believing, desiring) in order to plan ones own behavior and predict the behavior of others. This ability to reason about mental attitudes is impaired in patients with autism (Baron-Cohen 2000, Frith 2001). This reasoning disability leads to difficulties with such mental reasoning-based forms of behavior as pretend play, problems in understanding false beliefs, and the ability to tell lies. In our previous studies we demonstrated that this disability is correlated with corruption of axioms for reasoning about intention and belief (Galitsky 2002, 2005, Peterson et al 2004). The possibility to teach autistic children theory of mind has been assessed in multiple studies because of potentially important clinical implications. The theory of mind training studies conducted so far have shown that some individuals with autism can be taught to pass the particular tasks of reasoning about mental states (Swettenham 1996, Compilation copyright \u00a9 2007, American Association for Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. Sutton et al 1999). In most cases, it is natural to assume that trainees indeed apply one or another reasoning pattern rather than memorizing exact answers. Regrettably, in most cases, the studies of how individuals with autism acquire mental reasoning patterns are lacking an accurate formulation of these patterns, backed up by computational experiments. We believe the latter is essential to differentiate between mental and non-mental components of reasoning process. Our model of the corruption of human reasoning is based on the supposition that there are a number of standard axioms for mental entities; these axioms are genetically set for normal children and are corrupted in the autistic brain. The patterns of corruption vary from patient to patient and are correlated with the specifically outlined groups of autistic children. The simplest of such axiom is not see, therefore not know, highlighted in so called SallyAnne test (Baron-Cohen, 2000). The children with autism have to acquire these axioms explicitly, by means of direct training, using a variety of ways to introduce intentions, beliefs, knowledge and other attitudes of agents and relations between these attitudes. Teaching of such axioms may occur in both formal and natural languages; some of the patients prefer the former over the latter. Frequently, autism is not accompanied by learning disabilities, so the patents willingly participate in training programs of distance learning. Our practical experience shows that using softwarebased training allows us to hold the attention of autistic patients for much longer periods than the traditional means of one-to-one treatment by a human. Conventional rehabilitation is always associated with problem of keeping a patient in a responsive mode. Since for the autistic patients the strict rule-based learning is usually much easier than the direct introduction of the various forms of reasoning about mental world, the latter is achieved via the former. The methodology of using artificial mental reasoning systems for rehabilitation is based on teaching autistic children the \u201cmechanical\u201d forms of reasoning about mental world, because the attempts to directly introduce the emotional interaction with the others in a natural manner (e.g., teaching by examples, imitating) frequently fail. Similar to the theory of mind training settings introduced above, we teach individuals with autism mental entities and their combinations. However, unlike the previously mentioned studies, we use formalized means to teach mental entities, suggesting that they are more suitable to the peculiarities of autistic development. We use the non-human (computer) resources, readily acceptable by autistic children, to introduce them to the mental world (of humans) via formalized reasoning. The paradox of our methodology is that reasoning about the mental world, usually supposed to be irrational and displayed as an emotion, can nevertheless be considered from the abstract perspective, formalized and used in training. This hypothesis (Galitsky 2002) is used as a framework of our rehabilitation strategy to develop rational and emotional behavior in the real mental world. Traditionally, strict (formalized, mathematical) thinking is considered as an opposite notion to emotional (fuzzy, approximate) thinking and behavior. Since for the autistic trainees strict rule-based learning is much easier than the direct introduction of the various forms of emotional behavior, the latter is achieved via the former. A model of intention and belief suitable for teaching autistic children Below we will present a step-by-step introduction to our formalization intention and belief, adequate with respect to explaining its features to autistic trainees. Suggested rehabilitation exercises follow these steps to provide a consistent and comprehensive educational framework. Step A. Humans can adequately operate with the set of mental NL expressions containing not more then four embedded mutually dependent mental entities. We constrain the degree of embedding of mental metapredicates to be equal or less than four. The experimental studies of autistic reasoning have shown that both autistic subjects and controls display a monotonic increase in the complexity of mental formulas (BaronCohen 2000). For example, autistic children may properly handle the level of embedding zero by the age of 6 (you want), one by the age of 9 (I know that you want, know(i, want(you, ...)), and two by the age of 14 for most mental entities (I want him to know that you believe, want(i, know(him,believe(you,...))) ), whereas controls operate properly with the level of embedding three at the age of 8. Step B. In natural language (NL), each mental entity has a variety of meanings. In terms of logic programming, there can be multiple clauses defining a mental predicate via the other ones. Absence of such a family of definitions for a mental entity means that all possible meanings are implicitly assumed. Thus the problem of disambiguation in a formal language is posed for those situations where the agents exchange messages in formal language. In accordance to our experience, it is the first meaning for a mental entity that is hard to perceive and use for an autistic trainee. The consecutive meanings of a familiar entity are memorized and used much easier than the initial one. For example, it takes substantial efforts to introduce the entities of offending and forgiving to autistic children; they neither discern these actions in others nor reproduce them themselves. As only the first meaning that links these entities together is captured, further separate meanings and associated entities like reconciling are perceived more easily, given the respective formal clauses. Step C. The elementary expression for a mental state is of the form m1(a1[,a1\u2019 ], m2(a2[,a2\u2019 ], m3(a3[,a3\u2019 ], m4(a4[,a4\u2019 ], p)))) where m1 ...m4 are the metapredicates for mental states and actions, occurring with or without negation; m4, (m3 and m4), (m2 , m3 and m4) may be absent; in accordance to Step C, the total number of metapredicates is equal or less then four. a1 ... a4 are the active agents, square brackets denote the variables for the second agent a1\u2019 ... a4\u2019 (this is the passive agent for the mental actions, committed by the active agent, denoted by the first argument). For example, an action (and resultant state) with its actor and its receiver is expressed by the metapredicate inform(Actor, Receiver, Knowledge), and an action with two (possibly, symmetric) receivers \u2013 by metapredicate reconcile(Actor, Receiver1, Receiver2, MatterToSettleDown). The last variable, MatterToSettleDown, ranges over an arbitrary formula, which may be a physical, mental, or mixed state. Further on we will assume that mental metapredicates may have additional arguments and will not be showing them explicitly. Finally, p is a predicate or expression for physical action or state. We call such elementary expression for an arbitrary p a mental formula. It obeys the standard criteria of being a well-formed formula. Step D. The totality of well-formed mental formulas fall into three following categories: 1. A valid mental formula that represents an existing mental state. 2. A mental formula that always holds for any set of agents in any state (an axiom of modal logic, for example know(Who, know(Who, Knowledge)) ). 3. An invalid mental formula that cannot be interpreted. For example, we believe that it is impossible that a person pretends about someone else\u2019s mental state pretend(a1, a2, want(a3, Something)). Step E. The", "authors": [{"name": "Boris A.

Pyramid match kernel (PMK) is an efficient approach to quantifying the similarity between two unordered feature-sets, which allows well established kernel machines to learn with such representations. However, the approximation of PMK to the optimal feature matches deteriorates linearly with the dimension of local features, which prohibits the direct use of high dimensional features. In this paper, we propose a general, data-independent kernel to quantify the feature-set similarities, which gives an upper bound of approximation error independent of the dimension of local features. The key idea is to employ the technique of normal random projection to construct a number of low dimensional subspaces, and perform the original PMK algorithm therein. By leveraging on the invariance property of p-stable distributions, our approach achieves the desirable dimension-free property. Extensive experiments on the ETH-80 image database solidly demonstrate the advantage of our approach to high dimensional features.", "authors": [{"name": "Yi  Liu", "ids": ["1691635"]}, {"name": "Xulei  Wang", "ids": ["2339366"]}, {"name": "Hongbin  Zha", "ids": ["1687248"]}], "inCitations": ["12b765ac4d7e67737e44e51c5c29f70cfe48d2bd", "40451593f29ddbba748c5585fcc64856d43875ea", "83ff06c474231603062dc4751e3cd244b28dfa3c", "c7afae03b73ccf7ccdb6631cc4be51185c5b68ba", "15d7de9792aca94fa813e1ae0efead1a08b15c4d"], "outCitations": ["b91180d8853d00e8f2df7ee3532e07d3d0cce2af", "9f73f60fb07a979e53beac26c92eaaafb644a648", "e5c6c389be4a8dcfcd11915834cb30e865b506be", "b3e7d3e37e67af7f4546b46051063bea1b62dbae", "7f16904fad6641c6b599311965f16eaa35f0fb79", "faf8444bad76e8aa727c8b2df42fefe7b8242957", "05fb162abd00afc4cb453cad8685191fd199928c", "d4632690af6cb5522f6895586c16cb741e0757c5", "c66b39731b2d759c13971a09a66c72ce21950ee7", "2323173a0bddac0dd2586b17a2f3ac33f401c45c", "1db8a0b13b9561b3a5ed1c5962989199982de470", "cba5ad0b755434eda25c0147633a843e5b9cbd24", "d13a04844e4a781e5180987118f732d93aa9f398", "4cab9c4b571761203ed4c3a4c5a07dd615f57a91", "84497fd95b90e5bfe3ee0ed701808a8ec4c28690", "f198043a866e9187925a8d8db9a55e3bfdd47f2c", "90d6e7f2202f754d8588f9536e3f5b4a24701f24", "c467016d5df9337672c12c9ecaca7a24701003de", "c633c9a8bb41fbf23247fe26917d0848d4b58c66", "625bce34ec80d29242340400d916e799d2975430", "bd1f14e7531220c39fad8f86985cce7b283f035d"], "year": 2008, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/22a92b0628ffe066e66ffc5ea95839061a358e32", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2008/AAAI08-104.pdf", "http://www.aaaipress.org/Papers/AAAI/2008/AAAI08-104.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2008/aaai08-104.php", "http://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/vision/Visual&Robot/publication/doc/AAAI08_Liu.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "652-658", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2120431326", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

One representative model in large margin learning is the support vector machine (SVM). As the linear classification constraints in the SVM optimization problem are determined with certainty, the performance of SVM is limited. In this study, we propose a new large margin learning model, named probabilistic large margin machine (PLMM), with the linear classification constraints bounded by probabilistic thresholds. In comparison with the SVM, the PLMM incorporates the prior probabilities and the distribution information of each class into the decision hyperplane learning. Mathematically the optimization problem involved in the PLMM can be treated as only one second order cone programming (SOCP) problem, which can he solved efficiently. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the PLMM model", "authors": [{"name": "De-Feng  Wang", "ids": ["7497136"]}, {"name": "D.S.  Yeung", "ids": ["2157887"]}, {"name": "E.C.C.

The agents need to ensure that the service providers they select are trustworthy. Because the agents are autonomous and there is no central trusted authority, the agents help each other determine the trustworthiness of the service providers they are interested in. This help is rendered via a series of referrals to other agents, culminating in zero or more trustworthy service providers being identified. \n \nA trust network is a multiagent system where each agent potentially rates the trustworthiness of another agent. This paper develops a formal treatment of trust networks. At the base is a recently proposed representation of trust via a probability certainty distribution. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of two operators, concatenation and aggregation, using which trust ratings can be combined in a trust network. This paper motivates and establishes some important properties regarding these operators, thereby ensuring that trust can be combined correctly. Further, it shows that effects of malicious agents, who give incorrect information, are limited.", "authors": [{"name": "Yonghong  Wang", "ids": ["20085605"]}, {"name": "Munindar P.

This transformation aims to represent the input data in a more informative form that facilitates and improves subsequent steps. As a \"good'' set of basis functions result in better solutions and defining such functions becomes a challenge with increasing problem complexity, it is beneficial to be able to generate them automatically. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on Bellman residual for constructing basis functions using cascade-correlation learning architecture. We show how this approach can be applied to Least Squares Policy Iteration algorithm in order to obtain a better approximation of the value function, and consequently improve the performance of the resulting policies.

Traditionally, the approach around which these systems are designed is based upon an assumption made by Dorothy Denning in 1987 stating that malicious traffic should be statistically differentiable from normal traffic [1]; however, this statement was made regarding host systems and was not meant to be extended without adjustment to network systems. It is therefore necessary to change the granularity of this approach to find statistical anomalies per host as well as on the network as a whole. This approach lends itself well to the use of emergent monitoring agents per host that have a central aggregation point with a visualization of the network as a whole. This paper will discuss the structure, training, and deployment of such an agent-based intrusion detection system and analyze its viability in comparison to the more traditional anomaly-based approach to intrusion", "authors": [{"name": "Theodor  Richardson", "ids": ["2836863"]}, {"name": "Goran  Trajkovski", "ids": ["9445736"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["4e176662ce0510315b41d70c8e181a1c45e052b7", "ab1a0b13274e19f2d7991837ab4d954f0eeec100", "0a228bd42f7b3b03c83f5d2c0816a934ab9db6a0", "472cddea3ce8aa456bd6bc8c17578b1f888be3ee", "a101025338b17c011db576cd7f0678b784ffdf18", "8e1319e38ef787b36daba381d64633778cde8ad7", "e52ff12f3ce0c947b7c0684a189679ca917d4d29", "d53323f86f5aa8894c95a851c7658208f4fb8b68", "6916196f3eb4dc06cb4be3805312dfec3fac5844"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6278a98175777a9383a58cacb32cf6ae297c0c55", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/2007/fs07-04-011.php", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Fall/2007/FS-07-04/FS07-04-011.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI Fall Symposium: Emergent Agents and Socialities", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "72-77", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2902956853", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Structured duplicate detection was originally developed as an approach to external-memory graph search that reduces the number of expensive disk I/O operations needed to check stored nodes for duplicates, by using an abstraction of the search graph to localize memory references. In this paper, we show that this approach can also be used to reduce the number of slow synchronization operations needed in parallel graph search. In addition, we describe several techniques for integrating parallel and external-memory graph search in an efficient way. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques in a graph-search algorithm for domain-independent STRIPS planning.", "authors": [{"name": "Rong  Zhou", "ids": ["144922776"]}, {"name": "Eric A.

It is widely believed that the monoculture of P2P systems results in fast worm propagation in P2P networks and software diversity can decrease the virulence of worms and the effectiveness of repeated applications of single attacks. In order to break monocultures in P2P networks, we propose a P2P-based software diversity model and conduct both theoretical analysis and extensive simulations to test the performance of software diversity in containing P2P worm propagation. We find that our proposed software diversity model can efficiently improve the performance of worm prevention in P2P networks", "authors": [{"name": "Ying  Zhou", "ids": ["49455313"]}, {"name": "Zhong-Fu  Wu", "ids": ["1867759"]}, {"name": "Hao  Wang", "ids": ["39049654"]}, {"name": "Jiang  Zhong", "ids": ["49422620"]}, {"name": "Yong  Feng", "ids": ["145470994"]}, {"name": "Zheng-Zhou  Zhu", "ids": ["3035336"]}], "inCitations": ["9aed3523aa25b6f14c1fc5f2b58b7e3d4bc7dfd4", "c63223783c914d6418c38f38be00e8f21d36704e", "654604b953412bf37e2983ac7539e21f33c488bb", "b886ac1e78e0af8a00ac59430cdb69b34754f865", "eb10de886851e2ca83ddbaeab97f652ed85f3379", "9896161e2f0b0ffacc9ebd7804868a84b8b7cec1", "4dbeb2572fcbf0c2813042d2dfed299cb3294d08", "b60db70913dff6156d56692137af95f82b3c3ee2", "575f7373418bf2dc871f7aa14b987fc597c42a32", "266ee8a32f936a5ab02034d77184fa21989fc319", "e238a981f1983303d528936d461488ed26679231", "364c132472b3540b0bf5862b1f62392a01376356"], "outCitations": ["96752c9931666b2767b84a1adf8eba6d49c979a6", "680ba806b8a651e8cb2e2d64a9d6bc2325a8eea1", "cf025469b2d7e4b37c7f2d2bf0d46c6776f48fd4", "daa42319fca392d68fd98bb82b7c09bcf787441b", "4ce1d2b528b61c8f5de3f31f5fbc7080b8455603", "f48a3fc4ae93cb5aee3f179b81f8dacf63896cad", "3ffe8027979804595464aea423951213dbbdbdfa", "ba8b9162f895f15a6d15862d0c590bb3d29f44c3", "5f55d12b2d5cdcb20d8e80b9d99ccf7f2e515d15", "d61031326150ba23f90e6587c13d99188209250e", "d778e74e433e82e1cdc9d9b89429b2fa734496cf", "91d370107732f31f2b7b9a3add787650f83df16d", "29f0a4ba7176e870ce4ab54b6b627ee7c761d890", "71148ead320ac3ce5b62fcd51e4bacfd1f8fe91d", "88338fd6eb58ba3d559075cbd3e23e24891dd0a7", "a02e65354c84ba850f38e8fd4b9e374797f111fd", "06060cd45b1b9c371e0ede0ea5f10402c22e5c7e", "aa574bdaaf64c7fc7a51f5954b338b048a71575b", "8a112ce78b0852ab71c630ebc514d0634ec8aa35", "e63e6b842e106c5ddd0ce16526295e02b44754d6", "fdabfb8445eeebe5d37626d82f246d832ab07ebb", "8badf5b4cfb3b56df89c3b339b5a812420f43b22"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/357bc9eb221aa7c3968b7bf428bf15139cd31d44", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2006 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2006 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "2793-2798", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2006.259000", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2006.259000", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2149896868", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Assuming that the actions and the world are deterministic, planning can be represented in the classical propositional logic. Introducing nondeterminism (but not probabilities) or several initial states increases the complexity of the planning problem and requires the use of quantified Boolean formulae (QBF). \n \nThe currently leading logic-based approaches to conditional planning use explicitly or implicitly a QBF with the prefix \u2203\u2200\u2203. We present formalizations of the planning problem as QBF which have an asymptotically optimal linear size and the optimal number of quantifier alternations in the prefix: \u2203\u2200 and \u2200\u2203. This is in accordance with the fact that the planning problem (under the restriction to polynomial size plans) is on the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, not on the third.", "authors":

{"id": "dd54184cc0257535a050cbbd71d3b0d2db776932", "title": "How Intelligence Evolved?", "text": "A definition of intelligence in terms of the computational principles by which a sentient being may make sense of a universe structured according to the nilpotent universal computational rewrite system (NUCRS), with an infinite universal alphabet as discovered by Rowlands and Diaz, is briefly set out. This alphabet defines the semantics of quantum mechanics in terms of a universal grammar, such that the nilpotent generalization of Dirac\u2019s quantum mechanical equation is the computational machine order code. Investigations underway show that this discovery not only provides a fundamental semantic foundation for universal quantum computation, but is the likely keystone of a fundamental computational foundation for mathematics, quantum physics, the genetic code / molecular biology, neuroscience and an evolutionary cosmology. The NUCRS is a universal organizational principle, which provides well determined testable models, some already in agreement with experiment. These show that the structure of the cosmos, the genetic code, the human brain, and human language, correspond to quantum mechanics, as determined by the generalized nilpotent Dirac equation D(N) and the complementary semantic theory of quantum holographic pattern recognition specified by the 3 dimensional nilpotent Heisenberg Lie Group. The two nilpotent representations correspond to the required division of the universal nilpotent quantum mechanical state space (NQM) into its Clifford / fermionic and Lie / bosonic parts, where the 3D Heisenberg Lie algebra defines NQM Heisenberg uncertainty and, remarkably, a dual so that under the right circumstances this duality is the means by which to compute holographically, as, for example, in magnetic resonance imaging machines (MRI). We postulate that the NUCRS\u2019s power to be able connect to such significant ideas as nonstandard analysis over the surreal numbers fields, Wheeler\u2019s meaning circuit, the cosmological holographic principle, quantum holography, anticipatory computation and quantum thermodynamic machines, shows it to be an Evolutionary \u2018Anthropic\u2019 Semantic Computational Principle, by means of which a sentient being is able to comprehend the rules by which Nature is apparently structured. A semantic model of computation Success in science is measured by agreement between the predictions of the particular mathematical language description used and experiment, and the language\u2019s interdisciplinary breadth. Syntactic correctness of the language is thus a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition. It may only guarantee a combinatorial explosion of possible correct solutions, as now, for example, appears to be the case in string theory according to the admission of one of its originators, Leonard Susskind (Susskind, 2005). It supports Peter Woit\u2019s argument that string theory is, in Pauli\u2019s famous phrase, \u2018not even wrong\u2019 (Woit, 2006), because correct syntax is not accompanied by correct semantics, as in a semantic language model of computation, such as the rewrite systems synonymous with computing / information processing, which specify a grammar as well as a syntax appropriate to the problem needing solution. Thus, the theory of nilpotent quantum mechanics outlined below, may be able, we hypothesize, to give physicists their much sought after \u2018Theory of Everything\u2019 in the form of this NUCRS foundational universal organization principle. Rewrite systems concern the languages in which programs are rewritten as symbols for computing hardware to interpret. The NUCRS (Rowlands and Diaz, 2002, Diaz and Rowlands, 2005) is of particular significance, since its subset alphabets emerge in a minimal way and not only have a mathematical interpretation as algebra, but concern the nilpotent Dirac algebra, with which one can generalize Dirac\u2019s well known quantum mechanical equation, so as include not only mass and electric charge, but also the strong and weak charges, and, implicitly, the property of spin (Rowlands, 2004, 2005, 2006).. The NUCRS has a universal grammar in the sense that it delivers the entire infinite alphabet of symbols in one step, when presented with zero, in a simplified presentation, as the initial subset alphabet. (In a more technical extended presentation the need to start with anything at all can be dispensed with.) This universal system, we conjecture, has a minimum of two rewrite rules or productions (which it turns out are dual): i) a creation operation, delivering a new symbol at each invocation, where this new symbol may be a single character of the alphabet, a subset alphabet, or the entire alphabet, and ii) a conserve / proofreading operation, which examines all currently existing symbols to ensure that the bringing into existence of a new symbol or subset alphabet, etc., produces no anomalies. The NUCRS differs from traditional rewrite systems, of computational semantic language description with a fixed or finite alphabet, in that the rewrite rules allow new symbols to be added to the initial alphabet. As already stated, we start with just one symbol representing \u2018nothing\u2019 and two fundamental rules: create, a process which adds new symbols, and conserve, a process that examines the effect of any new symbol on those that currently exist, to ensure \u2018a zero sum\u2019 again. In this way at each step a new sub-alphabet of an infinite universal alphabet is created. However the system may also be implemented in an iterative way, so that a sequence of mathematical properties is required of the emerging sub-alphabets; and we have shown that one such sequential iterative path proceeds from nothing (as specified by the mathematical condition nilpotent) through conjugation, complexification, and dimensionalization to a stage in which no fundamentally new symbol is needed. At this point the alphabet is algebraically congruent with the nilpotent generalization of Dirac\u2019s famous quantum mechanical equation, showing that this equation defines the quantum mechanical \u2018machine order code\u2019 for all further (universal) computation corresponding to the infinite universal alphabet. The property of the universal nilpotent rewrite system that a new symbol can stand for itself, a sub-alphabet or the infinite universal alphabet, allows NUCRS to rewrite itself, so as to enable it to describe the ontological structure at a higher (hierarchical) level in terms of those at lower levels, beginning with the fundamental level. This rewrite system with its nilpotent bootstrap methodology from \u2018nothing / its empty state\u2019 thus defines the requirement for universal quantum computation to constitute a semantic model of computation with a universal grammar. It is also significant that, though the universal rewrite system generates both number systems and algebras, it is not confined to these systems, and does not depend on the preexistence of numerical or algebraic concepts, or any of the ideas of set theory, and the zero is not confined to being that of the empty set. The mathematical structure generated derives rationals from reals, not reals from rationals; and shows that complexification logically precedes discrete numbering, a result that cannot be derived from any form of set theory (Rowlands and Diaz, 2002, Diaz and Rowlands, 2005). Such a nilpotent computional rewrite system describing both arithmetic and geometric properties must describe what is called universal computer construction, i.e. such nilpotent quantum computation will be both computer universal in the sense of arithmetic and constructor universal in the sense of geometry. That is, it includes both universal digital computation as discovered by Turing (Turing, 1936) in the form of the universal Turing Machine model, and universal computer construction or self replication as revealed by Von Neumann (Von Neumann, 1966). Scientific perspectives on semantic computation From the above it would appear that: i) both theoretical physics and mathematics, grounded in nilpotent quantum physical process action, are single, possibly equivalent, bodies of human linguistic / semiotic knowledge emergent from the human brain, a quantum physical semantic machine, as the evolutionary result of the semantic natural physical law NUCRS describes; and ii) that, as proposed by Langlands, mathematics is indeed (in this new computational NUCRS foundation) a single inseparable body of knowledge, where theoretical physics will be the same thing as mathematics, thus explaining what is often referred to as \u2018the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in relation to physics\u2019 (Chapline, 1999). That is, the NUCRS describes the basis for two new foundational disciplines, the computational foundations of physics and mathematics. Thus, this law\u2019s semantic mathematical language description would be expected, in addition to correct syntax, to provide the description of such properties as: i) a measure, metric and Hamiltonian / Lagrangian for each variable, process and system respectively described (examples, Fatmi and Resconi, 1988; Schempp, 1992); and ii) thermodynamic principles in relation to quantum measurement, where information becomes a physical resource such as entropy production, as occurs in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines, where the real and virtual imagery of 3 + 1 relativistic space-time physical structures, exist independently of the presence of any observer.

During object manipulation, object dynamics can be extremely complex, non-linear and challenging to specify. To avoid modeling the full complexity of possible dynamics. I instead use a model which switches between a discrete number of simple dynamics models. By learning these models and extending Porta's continuous state POMDP framework (Porta et at. 2006) to incorporate this switching dynamics model, we hope to handle tasks that involve absolute and relative dynamics within a single framework. This dynamics model may be applicable not only to object manipulation tasks, but also to a number of other problems, such as robot navigation.

In that the experience afforded by a sensory neuron can only be quantified within statistical limits from the incidence of spikes across multiple presentations of a stimulus, consciousness remains inaccessible to direct measurement on a single trial. In this way, the model disambiguates subjective experience from objective neural properties. The model adopts a quantum mechanical formalism, in which the state of the neuron is represented as a vector in \nA complex vector space, or as a projector from the space onto that vector. Extension of this formalism to more realistic neural systems merely requires the assimilation of the quantum mechanical principles applicable in this broader context. \nInitially, a mathematical expression for the smooth evolution of a single dimension of perceptual experience will be derived for the single neuron case. \n \nThere follows a description of how the neural state itself might evolve in this \nprocess, utilising the quantum operations formalism of amplitude damping. This approach reveals how smooth evolution of conscious experience might arise from discrete spikes and discontinuous synaptic interaction between neurons. A tensor product formalism will be used to describe the combination of state spaces of individual neurons to form a composite neural space, in which a pure 'mental state' would represent unified conscious experience. The binding of elementary features in this non-local mental state would be reflected in specific patterns of correlated neural firing between remote brain regions. In contrast, the conventional neuron doctrine is classical and local realistic. Local realistic constraints, expressed as Bell Inequalities, limit potential correlations in firing between remote neurons, presenting an opportunity for the experimental test of the scheme in a neurophysiologic thought experiment.", "authors": [{"name": "Andrew  Duggins", "ids": ["2160832"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["14e61db0367073ef426317e34c8eb9bd242a0a5f", "e944b8134f4f53d4a5c32ffbc86eaab1f3291ef0", "5fbca39db49ed2158cea2ae79d99b7634ab06524", "c1a09e2d91009f11c464640d5fd2b9c843178ab3", "0935d59ec2391073d332e08ad57c4141a680a34f", "4a61a3f56b59945abadbaa2523170bf06946e556"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2ae358ce988e2e29564664a656fa9ae4521d4dcc", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Spring/2007/SS-07-08/SS07-08-011.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Spring/2007/ss07-08-011.php"], "venue": "AAAI Spring Symposium: Quantum Interaction", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "71-74", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2402843913", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

To draw the chemical staying in the vicinity of the source, the robot generates water currents by waving the arms that mimic maxillipeds of a crayfish. Depending on the patterns for waving of the arms, various flow fields are generated. Determination of the direction of the chemical source is enabled by collecting water samples from different directions. Active flow generation thus serves for extracting desired information from the surrounding chemical concentration field. The development of SPR (surface plasmon resonance) chemical sensors for the crayfish robot is also described. SPR sensors compact enough to mount on the robot are realized by employing gold nanostructures for SPR excitation. Comparison between the SPR sensors and the electrochemical sensors used in the previous paper is made to show the importance of sample collection on the sensor surfaces.", "authors": [{"name": "Mari  Ohashi", "ids": ["46371350"]}, {"name": "Yuichi  Minagawa", "ids": ["21524653"]}, {"name": "Yuki  Myoren", "ids": ["3170125"]}, {"name": "Hiroshi  Ishida", "ids": ["145446785"]}], "inCitations": ["f5cda33f4ca4e5ce54a858f6615170d20007d9f9", "4f738254e570ab7935aee54b734469a3e9f443c3", "a04960c443ce238cec9a2ce7c224c5efed893a7e", "57a45eff1333453dc652e94f9ae8a6ca4b8e90d3"], "outCitations": ["89f6082ecb358f95f1c7abe573687dacc2cead8c", "270773b94dddacde050137eff0a314c134aa74e2", "ee210a7962fcadca24efed772a2acb0e86aa13c5", "13571095cbfb3a1380c09149aa5b3045999d979b", "27563e29cf017e44ae90c647a1dd9fc54058db66", "1e62a26f2f1aee73a5f7358f5af5a63830d70101", "3a61bed6197606e53e43c8558fd9460e59788602", "0b5209d7ad55c37a5b4b1b5b60515bec0e92f2b5", "b319b30d1982e1d36e067f19920c5a5c516dc0f3", "4f762e39c2544a3631c72502fb8b38a16a60ac54"], "year": 2008, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/47066b458e2fe5411188f1a6eed1c97c5cd92b10", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2008.93"], "venue": "2008 Seventh International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalName": "2008 Seventh International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "482-488", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2008.93", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2008.93", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2160434838", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Broadly defined, games are situations where multiple players make interacting decisions; each players\u2019 choice depends on the choices of the other players. The formal study of games has origins in economics, but in recent years game theory has drawn increasing interest in computer science. Computer science offers a rich set of tools for advancing the art of game analysis, including simulation methods that can be used to explore strategic interactions in games. Game theory has achieved significant success and popularity, but practitioners have had mixed success applying the theory to real strategy design problems (Roth 2002). An acute challenge in game theory applications is the size and complexity of real games, which often require players to choose among very large sets of distinct courses of action. A second (related) challenge is that players and analysts typically face substantial uncertainty about the outcomes due to computational and observational limitations. Large games exacerbate these uncertainties to the extent that they arise from resource limitations. This form of uncertainty is particularly difficult to characterize due to the intricacies of gathering evidence about game outcomes. Consider, for example, the Trading Agent Competition Supply Chain Management game (TAC SCM) (Arunachalam & Sadeh 2005; Kiekintveld et al. 2006). This is a game of significant interest among researchers, and gametheoretic investigation of this game forms part of my thesis. The game is an hour-long simulation of a supply chain scenario played by automated agents. The space of possible agent designs is extremely large and \u2013 despite countless hours of investigation \u2013 no optimal solution is known or on the horizon. Like many real games of interest, TAC SCM is defined in a compact form, by a set of game rules and game server that implements those rules.1 We can gather evidence about the SCM game by simulating game instances, but even using thousands of hours of simulation time we are", "authors": [{"name": "Christopher  Kiekintveld", "ids": ["1801567"]}], "inCitations":

{"id": "1de5c530716de032d89aa6bf0e0b618494d74bda", "title": "Transfer Learning via Dimensionality Reduction", "text": "Transfer learning addresses the problem of how to utilize plenty of labeled data in a source domain to solve related but different problems in a target domain, even when the training and testing problems have different distributions or features. In this paper, we consider transfer learning via dimensionality reduction. To solve this problem, we learn a low-dimensional latent feature space where the distributions between the source domain data and the target domain data are the same or close to each other. Onto this latent feature space, we project the data in related domains where we can apply standard learning algorithms to train classification or regression models. Thus, the latent feature space can be treated as a bridge of transferring knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. The main contribution of our work is that we propose a new dimensionality reduction method to find a latent space, which minimizes the distance between distributions of the data in different domains in a latent space. The effectiveness of our approach to transfer learning is verified by experiments in two real world applications: indoor WiFi localization and binary text classification.", "authors": [{"name": "Sinno Jialin Pan", "ids": ["1746914"]}, {"name": "James T.

We share our experiences and lessons learned after running the system for a year and a half. We discuss the issues that were brought about by operating in a distributed data environment. We believe that these issues will need to be addressed by any system that performs complex event recognition in such an environment.

Introduction The Artificial Intelligence community, and the AAAI conference in particular, has long been concerned with counteracting the tendency towards fragmentation, and refocusing on the seminal vision of a unified machine intelligence. The Senior Member Presentation Track itself is one welcome effort in that direction. The purpose of this paper is to delineate the roles that constraint modeling and reasoning can play in pursuing this integrative agenda. Tutorial I will provide a very brief introduction to constraint satisfaction using the popular Sudoku game for illustration. Constraints are sometimes viewed primarily in terms of search, but I would argue that their role in representation and reasoning is equally if not more important. The Sudoku puzzle has recently achieved wide popularity. The puzzle involves a 9 by 9 grid of cells, further divided into nine 3 by 3 blocks of 9 cells each. A given puzzle starts with some cells filled in with one of the digits 1 through 9. The object is to fill the remaining cells with digits such that each row, column and block uses all 9 digits. This puzzle exhibits the classic features of a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). There is a set of problem variables, in this case the Sudoku cells. For each variable there is a set of possible values, in this case the digits 1 through 9. There are constraints that specify which combinations of values are acceptable, in this case the Copyright \u00a9 2006, American Association for Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. requirements that no two cells in any row, column or block can have the same digit. A solution to the Sudoku CSP an assignment of digits (values) to each of the empty cells (variables) that satisfies the Sudoku rules (constraints). It is important to recognize that the CSP paradigm has been extended in a variety of directions. It embraces optimisation, uncertainty, change, preferences, continuous sets of values, constraints over many variables, etc. Of course, CSPs are not restricted to puzzles. Some other examples of constraints: \u2022 The meeting must start at 6:30. \u2022 The separation between the soldermasks and nets should be at least 0.15mm. \u2022 This model only comes in blue and green. \u2022 This cable will not handle that much traffic. \u2022 John prefers not to work on weekends. \u2022 The demand will probably be for more than 5 thousand units in August. Some examples of constraint satisfaction or optimization problems: \u2022 Schedule these employees to cover all the shifts. \u2022 Optimize the productivity of this manufacturing process. \u2022 Configure this product to meet my needs. \u2022 Find any violations of these design criteria. \u2022 Optimize the use of this satellite camera. \u2022 Align these amino acid sequences.", "authors": [{"name": "Eugene C.

However, most works pointed out their inefficiency in detecting novel attacks. In this paper, we address the inadequacy of decision trees for behavioral anomaly detection. We first explain why decision trees fail in detecting most of novel attacks. In particular, we provide experimental results showing that minimum description length (MDL) principle used while inducing decision trees is among the main reasons in their failure in detecting novel attacks. Then we propose relaxing MDL principle in order to build compatible decision trees more suitable for novel behavior detection. The strategy of relaxing MDL principle is to exploit additional tests/features in order to discriminate between normal behaviors and intrusive ones while standard decision trees only rely on minimum subset of tests/features. Experimental studies, carried out on real and recent http traffic and several Web attacks, show the significant improvements that can be made by relaxed MDL decision trees.", "authors": [{"name": "Karim  Tabia", "ids": ["2766118"]}, {"name": "Salem  Benferhat", "ids": ["144778431"]}], "inCitations": ["67ea7f402dc514e8a5d593eb81847a3b381471ee", "7b3f850a70597c1fef1ee3fbd7a4d2ac5c413af4", "0c48d3e191a10ee5f26403cb961cf2e8d2d75584", "2985a1dfd09302d4ea0a821143859b6b3338877e", "735cadc7481860be3360406edd6e095cd90e839d", "947938e04b54b34eb3cf03d4d1c32d549166976a", "c373853d50c5d3678b207bf70e143a1ff20c8620"], "outCitations": ["bf6ea3104b8f70b09bcf7535606d8ac3c5b7964b", "3561756ca2a54427ed844ebfbfae66ad8f792bc5", "d382b9c11e5c6a8e173fbeb442545e3be8d3e3a5", "e92d6a22e95e5501bf0208199c560339900c7662", "434aa21b999fb9cb8d2d87816726df4bf7385922", "408e9bba656c9438231d87c5dbc366b773aa252f", "8017699564136f93af21575810d557dba1ee6fc6", "b90eae671a3d7663c7e166890af7113d62293f13", "35b3233e521f1e9a34837c30be1957858f8f35fe", "3e89ded324cec6342b544bf32b19ea44ff90403f", "807c1f19047f96083e13614f7ce20f2ac98c239a", "bcee7c85d237b79491a773ef51e746bbbcf48e35", "16a778c5d83cce2f4c4af46efafb927e7d0d8e60", "550aec01bf61ff9fd271debc394a8c3dfa59657b", "6f8d2ae8b64f8464bcf1101d77b353f99a3b2661", "69131c6e5bcb7429764c6fb41e16a178aea90a77", "ed6f656ed75520789583463aa3664f54058d63a2", "6e890900cfd5eb8abebabb1f0621adb6f933bd03", "d63e72fb652ca318a3dc4a73e460f8c7314b2018", "b2487cccd5bd584d8b05e97da4592370386b605f", "63b23d8fac97dd64a878471b5d2b08514f511569", "9ee813dc4e75592fd77c841228702131daa99240", "70a769a97167899959493360d1c93b80ea18b6da"], "year": 2008, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0904eecf5b2514c2a213a562c608819efb6b81fe", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2008.63"], "venue": "2008 Seventh International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalName": "2008 Seventh International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "665-670", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2008.63", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2008.63", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2115804797", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

However, players do not see games in the same light: most consider Go or Chess to be more complex than Monopoly. In this paper, we discuss a new measure of game complexity that links existing state-of-the-art algorithms for computing approximate equilibria to a more human measure. In particular, we consider the range of skill in a game, i.e. how many different skill levels exist. We then modify existing techniques to design a new algorithm to compute approximate equilibria whose performance can be captured by this new measure. We use it to develop the first near Nash equilibrium for a four round abstraction of poker, and show that it would have been able to win handily the bankroll competition from last year's AAAI poker competition.", "authors": [{"name": "Martin  Zinkevich", "ids": ["8195063"]}, {"name": "Michael H.

Besides the problem of unfair ratings, rating submission is voluntary in most trust management systems. Buyers do not have direct incentives to provide ratings because, for example, providing reputation ratings of sellers requires some effort (Josang, Ismail, & Boyd 2005).

Weblogs (or blogs) are a potentially fruitful genre for exploration of credibility assessment due to public disclosure of information that might reveal trustworthiness and expertise by webloggers (or bloggers) and availability of audience evaluations. The objectives of the planned exploratory study are to compile a list of factors that users take into account in credibility assessment of blog sites, order them in terms of users\u2019 perceived importance, and determine which factors can be recognized and evaluated with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. With partial automation in mind, we propose an analytical framework for blog credibility assessment based on four profile factors: 1) the blogger\u2019s expertise and the amount of offline identity disclosure, 2) the blogger\u2019s trustworthiness (or the overtly stated value system including beliefs, goals, and values), 3) information quality, and 4) appeals of a personal nature. We describe a multi-stage study that combines a qualitative study of credibility judgments of blog-readers with NLP-based analysis of blogs.

Measuring LP performance has become an area of concern for companies and policy makers. HTM LP is complex to conduct due to its nonlinearity of influenced factors. Support vector machines (SVM) have been successfully employed to solve nonlinear regression and time series problems. Grey system theory successfully utilizes accumulated generating data instead of original data to build forecasting model, which makes raw data stochastic weak, or reduces noise influence in a certain extent. However, the application combining grey system theory and SVM for LP forecasting is rare. In this study, a grey support vector machines with genetic algorithms (GSVMG) is proposed to forecast HTM LP. In addition, GM (1, N) model of grey system is used to add a grey layer before neural input layer and white layer after SVM layer. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are used to determine free parameters of support vector machines. Evaluation method has been used for comparing the performance of forecasting techniques. The experiments show that the GSVMG model is outperformed GM (1, N) model and SVM with genetic algorithms (SVMG) model, and HTM LP forecasting based on GSVMG is of validity and feasibility", "authors": [{"name": "Sheng  Xu", "ids": ["47411394"]}, {"name": "Hui-Fang  Zhao", "ids": ["47941060"]}, {"name": "Jie  Liu", "ids": ["46700321"]}, {"name": "Xiang  Sun", "ids": ["144927864"]}], "inCitations": ["2cc51704c38ee63f2145fc0c174a05fee536d562", "c7fd2260b6b3597964890d599256d9397770d984", "85edcd939668c5d41b899968b900f03e853b032f"], "outCitations": ["fc2806a373aefe9ec9fd02e6369fdf9b6a6ff8e4", "8213dbed4db44e113af3ed17d6dad57471a0c048", "5451278e1a11cf3f1be28a05f38d36c8641e68f7", "90c458a3657410306ead9f41ee996c1146630335", "3dc7461765bf0002c6b55b6db40f4bc73f0be653", "53105244a3e06c5d385dd0ff0525f2c770bfc721", "2e62d1345b340d5fda3b092c460264b9543bc4b5", "3907bb28c9597339be3635c8e40858ba81f8dbed", "b29859f7f1f812da60a41caddeb06c6522819f4b", "f759bbdb34ba064c36d0942becbd7925be8405b3", "c7e881e8e5732553c929f648004f6ba6e8d4471c", "5a96eab23333cb8bf037917f5bf08ab22e6a6329"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f2395ab888efe743639c4b6a175f6f644b5cab2d", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2006 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2006 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "2419-2424", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258772", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258772", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2168624428", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

The algorithm firstly seeks the successors of the initial identical character tuples according to successor tables to obtain all the identical tuples and their levels. Then the result of LCS can be obtained by tracing back from the identical character tuple with the largest level. For n biosequences X 1, X2, ..., Xn, the time complexity of sequentially execution of our algorithm is O(L). Here L is the number of identical character tuples. The time complexity of our parallel algorithm is O(|LCS|), where LCS is the length of the longest common substring of X1, X2, ... , Xn. This time complexity is independent of the number of sequences n. Some experiments have been conducted on the gene sequences of tigr database using MPP parallel computer Shenteng 1800.

Probabilistic planners can reason over the missing information and produce plans that take into account the uncertainty about the environment. Unfortunately though, they can rarely scale up to the problems that are of interest in real-world. In this paper, however, we show that for a certain subset of problems we can develop a very efficient probabilistic planner. The proposed planner, called PPCP, is applicable to the problems for which it is clear what values of the missing information would result in the best plan. In other words, there exists a clear preference for the actual values of the missing information. For example, in the problem of robot navigation in partially-known environments it is always preferred to find out that an initially unknown location is traversable rather than not. The planner we propose exploits this property by using a series of deterministic A*-like searches to construct and refine a policy in anytime fashion. On the theoretical side, we show that once converged, the policy is guaranteed to be optimal under certain conditions. On the experimental side, we show the power of PPCP on the problem of robot navigation in partially-known terrains. The planner can scale up to very large environments with thousands of initially unknown locations. We believe that this is several orders of magnitude more unknowns than what the current probabilistic planners developed for the same problem can handle. Also, despite the fact that the problem we experimented on in general does not satisfy the conditions for the solution optimality, PPCP still produces the solutions that are nearly always optimal.", "authors": [{"name": "Maxim  Likhachev", "ids": ["145371551"]}, {"name": "Anthony  Stentz", "ids": ["1722938"]}], "inCitations": ["16204addff6ffddd6f79094822922a5c1b4ee705", "46b22920f8b9a2ae27da01cfcf3b7ad86b5c48ac", "482c8694672b43a8840a2cda49e71c38667eab41", "be66df1b3e51100346bd0f74d0ec5d7ea2627141", "a25a8de6e24d109bbff9059aa9074bf296ea9224", "ae5e4f5ed1dbb97963183d672dc32b31ec483552", "6a421fb8d104c3ce0e6628d0d563dec5827d32f9", "b3afd4c1b8cf0d6ac98b2f3d7bfa9049246adc18", "d2da2d26d0dc6b5f3bb85c704982c859c5839c30", "8d4a609a3d1d9b44246496521c6dfa56863ace79", "6d12a3578280ce7c1a8097bfec923e353a4a28c9", "3f44fbc83ea596399f298bbf29dcae99002469e1", "2ae7546ea5f6795c4a2783b5c3a05ac29fe76ab1", "315a71237db17769c3c01ed0ca8fa20505bda452", "58a901c42db3c217db2b10a72c2802c7cef458b9", "68c0fc5ee18e29a12d766022128b3373c0539316", "65f18877e720e68aca182e2aee6b39c007dd12b6", "ae860147cec98f306406d65a677c29de2515b698", "59aeb28038980ad40dc748c59c8b078f97603c8e"], "outCitations": ["099c7a0ec8900658838e7721bbf2ae289d205d62", "20f0d7d9369ae0fc8ba0a9713738d993d30d7e80", "3a15102bd71c2de0c8bbc720ca4304760b24ffca", "a46d082412b85dda60e2855d67478df344d79c9e", "043a88eefa649b20519fda7b2e9af25fef2ec790", "eaec01700f5ea63af311cfd7a70a3869460ce080", "b49bb7ecd2afd6461c78ff29536839b5ee45cd15", "d51eb16dfed68bf6e16b8b4516d607370b91189a", "5b69e60b839899227e11d5faf2a010fa812445c0", "e4032760927e8394fb12a5c0276a46b23ed2b9cc", "5c30432167c0e1ad81f4ea0fde8aeb07a394aa50", "057b73aff78408b1c32054a552d26311a596c8c5", "bde11578e3bfd9be6d63f1a2b848e76631d0ebc5"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/76e4016da503b093dd72e93a3f62d552aec8d9b5", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maxim/files/ppcp_aaai06.pdf", "http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~maximl/files/ppcp_aaai06.pdf", "http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~maxim/docs/ppcp_aaai06.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2006/aaai06-136.php", "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./maxim/files/ppcp_aaai06.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2006/AAAI06-136.pdf", "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maxim/docs/ppcp_aaai06.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "860-867", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1531221704", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

For example, in a binary classification problem it is often the case that examples of one class are abundant, while examples of the other class are in short supply.

This work presents a comprehensive empirical study of learning when examples from one class are extremely rare, but examples of the other class(es) are plentiful. Specifically, we address the issue of how many examples from the abundant class should be used when training a classifier on data where one class is very rare.

In the AITC design, the Taylor linearization technique is employed to increase the learning ability of ORCMAC and the on-line adaptive laws are derived based on the Lyapunov stability analysis and the Hinfin control technique, so that the stability of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed. Finally, the proposed control system is applied to control an inverted pendulum system and a Genesio chaotic system. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control scheme can achieve favorable tracking performances for the uncertain nonlinear systems with unknown dynamic functions and under the occurrence of external disturbance.", "authors": [{"name": "Ya-Fu  Peng", "ids": ["143835459"]}, {"name": "Pin-Hsuan  Huang", "ids": ["15705704"]}, {"name": "Cheng-Han  Li", "ids": ["1767588"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["ffd55561cbc7f9d230b18a96445236d2674ab94a", "ee6549620df57a319054331f1b2e116f2ced82b8", "f513bf5717b4b443927470bedcdc36cebfc0f53b", "48fbf5ce0621e785fb0bec34188b9d650e48175d", "d7c9e99cc3a4df6d7b0423e2e812976c6116a23d", "878922d0d605b6092f605f7193d593f12c08d707", "a2df3a35cbcfde6cd3228fdb496af093e1033134", "6597e22f934b7f2f919450b61d14d81993be1143", "b0edc66d52caffdac8face11b38a3ecf5d9609d3", "336d7dfd5d22fdda370d457e0f3467caac081696", "fb3563eb4f9a0fa76f761ef7e069687eaace9e99", "18aea87f22f2ca8775007d34b8f2f2d43276078d", "10a9286df1d47b4a4bd91d0c0d41129edca6e622", "c31979bfe6f5aa5eefb4b3540da65e114ccebfce", "e54f00da3befa0c91e19a7a12a4242cf42433cd3", "2820cf77f4abc8b1196e3efd0b7ff35966ad0898", "b7271b6c3ec1be195018827d06c92f1bd4797f08", "01fc47fbc6665d07d9d97ca185e206c89393f3ba"], "year": 2008, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/620934087a9acbafe58d91bbf66136daefaa823c", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "7", "journalPages": "3804-3810", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4621068", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4621068", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2147545280", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

An approach to tackle this problem is to filter the resulting rule set, which reduces the rules, at the cost of also eliminating potentially interesting ones. In exploring a new dataset in search of relevant associations, it may be more useful for miners to have an overview of the space of rules obtainable from the dataset, rather than getting an arbitrary set satisfying high values for given interest measures. We describe a rule extraction approach that favors rule diversity, allowing miners to gain an overview of the rule space while reducing semantic redundancy within the rule set. This approach adopts an itemset-driven rule generation coupled with a cluster-based filtering process. The set of rules so obtained provides a starting point for a user-driven exploration of it.", "authors": [{"name": "Claudio Haruo Yamamoto", "ids": ["27698070"]}, {"name": "Maria Cristina Ferreira de Oliveira", "ids": ["2437107"]}, {"name": "Magaly Lika Fujimoto", "ids": ["1771644"]}, {"name": "Solange Oliveira Rezende", "ids": ["1806906"]}], "inCitations": ["bdc323689b8e604020874d5ab18706e3071f87be", "65d829cc13c7fdb288e4f3cf6385eab49ef67897", "0141751a98df764082546d1c2abcbe07417b203f", "66d2e0be22dda4472dcf13962b846c33ad4726d9", "41b9926f8bd57eb1f7f7b4843eb93521f9829bb4", "02be49b2c32467683b3e3ef623885b077a4b4dd3", "0d4f54724cc457ac462c897aebbf948fa8d81a33"], "outCitations": ["5eef24aac20bfed5a6c7702b13ae51a1f29c1b29", "52526fd96abe1b0d6a275c768d10fc30b26387cc", "c361e060d5a977aa542b9013bca7e392c34b1261", "4db27d7734e98b6c2080cc186ab214c015666121", "587b2c46da9fd6f63d50d992bdb70dabbad39407", "32398e1de371d811c4947eef893810ac9e08bbbf", "6fe8c5bf8dddaadf10c765133d38dfef5714347f", "383efbf6e1927830e5cd98a4df82ab3fb4a5a220", "5e47a5d48dcba1dc138a11a6212e23019d414fe0", "2d61616531b0ffaa3dab57a517b8e16163fe2409", "fff0a1f746463c9330cccde3b44f1c43363f83de"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fec9f8b42498235cd19626d7e312580f5628ff07", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2007.45"], "venue": "Sixth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA 2007)", "journalName": "Sixth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA 2007)", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "87-92", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2007.45", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2007.45", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

For example, Martha Stewart\u2019s company may have wished to assess the degree of harshness of news articles about her in the recent past. Likewise, a World Bank official may wish to assess the degree of criticism of a proposed dam in Bangladesh. The ability to gauge opinion on a given topic is therefore of critical interest. In this paper, we develop a suite of algorithms which take as input, a set D of documents as well as a topic t, and gauge the degree of opinion expressed about topic t in the set D of documents. Our algorithms can return both a number (larger the number, more positive the opinion) as well as a qualitative opinion (e.g. harsh, complimentary). We assess the accuracy of these algorithms via human experiments and show that the best of these algorithms can accurately reflect human opinions. We have also conducted performance experiments showing that our algorithms are computationally fast.", "authors": [{"name": "Carmine  Cesarano", "ids": ["2906534"]}, {"name": "Bonnie J.

However, even very accurate classifiers may output class probabilities of rather poor quality. One way of overcoming this problem is by means of calibration, i.e., mapping the original class probabilities to more accurate ones. Previous studies have however indicated that random forests are difficult to calibrate by standard calibration methods. In this work, a novel calibration method is introduced, which is based on a recent finding that probabilities predicted by forests of classification trees have a lower squared error compared to those predicted by forests of probability estimation trees (PETs). The novel calibration method is compared to the two standard methods, Platt scaling and isotonic regression, on 34 datasets from the UCI repository. The experiment shows that random forests of PETs calibrated by the novel method significantly outperform uncalibrated random forests of both PETs and classification trees, as well as random forests calibrated with the two standard methods, with respect to the squared error of predicted class probabilities.", "authors": [{"name": "Henrik  Bostr\u00f6m", "ids": ["1777235"]}], "inCitations": ["040d3468f3b5d931509d28a117f9adbf34921202", "4907618d369e168a634fc696e7af1be6fdce4a0f", "9b15f91cf7ffc7fd2a02875683d9f693bec3e570", "3259e8682ded7e81ec2ab33a235982f9450c27f3", "755fb4790e80e992346e87b4271da518163cc5e7", "d2c82e4569a76b68b3eb28ecb3fca073610b5562", "abce6510c78e00c6e4155fea7c7ba92f35cc0395", "5463cb6b179e7f458b53e6a8082836d4e619b602", "6971ca071dcc17c684e99994289ddd29d7447ef7", "13c2553f9393c1688fddc29dd01ff993398731b0", "e04422319350afedb94115312dfa003811c94a04", "7ca9f33fd207a8540a8907e48ed752f28f76b3fb", "65acdc3e53336f5c0eddc9c8abe5b61d14cfb1f4", "13810ac602eb2310270989f3b4968915c21d3928", "a1fd0d1a01e07e597b17ee816124d694c608be9b", "500285ef4387eb8d26b30c2bf5901e3200850b3c", "8bb0f0324b1640f73adf22bcab7c14c4c6284a29", "b91ea525914499553ce6c185b3060469bca83df3", "b3e2a7a1ea3a382bbecb4ffd6b5c0f404428e591", "0e46ffedd9d05674620d5ab048cfd83c00f14750", "17cf9449a64f5a46e03882e6fcaf5d3a8225664e", "77a7a5f11cf19be0236966b38a4450d27bb696ae", "84c3a80c5812089b57a0115e5d585b854db6ef2b", "ec7766beff83e4774895df6830b83e60c3d201f4", "190e541974792a75e7e4ad4b4a7f83643f044d8f", "8bf682cec71bfb1e6632d0312ccc27b804743b82", "f279197d29954dbbe4889600b9aaeed9b5d3e56d", "d6ce9fd5404201b7107937dc8b5e8a8342c7a79a", "1856deadb095389ee48a474d90862a51802224f5", "7404d9020500f5d39206f7f59448a8dc2cb521f5", "3cef3c0bfe5322ca0e5d34a46640ac38b9b054af", "56702f0fc4d4300522a55b86f3ee39706c727ef5", "560fdf8fdf8bba21b2d6775aaacaa231266dcbe3", "3720ce2f5aa51b75df5f2f24bd51eeae74013cf2", "04e3ce2252a3be879d82beb2e6634b67f206a522", "e34d21582f57a95e1ef6a7a304bb36ce4d813357", "ebac3c79a4de25a2644de90c6aeabe7b55a686f9", "8e6f72cfdcd68100b4888d93e181da576820e2e7", "72c698740a9250c67a71f87630d9a5a0f7ee7e00", "aa91a9b374215c58e903ef6386a67798741da8b5", "53c8dccd276876b0c030f59dedea382c90af00da"], "outCitations": ["faf6d9ac789935de24bc87b0d3d55a128af96ee5", "8f1408d33858a78f90f9000a34856664fc639ae4", "a76a95c8766550c84be48efb70dc7391e84553df", "d1ee87290fa827f1217b8fa2bccb3485da1a300e", "b32852abb9e55424f2dfadefa4da74cbe194059c", "eae3948747c9d051314c1f5851957b833aa83eca", "36bca41eba5a7cea8d69a89ee7bc24923bc380ba", "4f67a122ec3723f08ad5cbefecad119b432b3304", "fc80cdf18198dc5677ccabe501b6f7209c28483c", "67a04f9e9763b7f0699c3da5436d53ee676ecb44", "8017699564136f93af21575810d557dba1ee6fc6", "feee6551179612b9691f021b583d8a99b81b9b86", "c1e76c802006d345adadb3c2b4f10b2d6c733e78", "347b571a52d337f813d8c16c589a8e0b404bef28", "13d4c2f76a7c1a4d0a71204e1d5d263a3f5a7986"], "year": 2008, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e4d744a9d9f8b2491138b0f69ee1091bcb2ce8d3", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2008.107", "https://people.dsv.su.se/~henke/papers/bostrom08b.pdf", "http://people.dsv.su.se/~henke/papers/bostrom08b.pdf", "http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:283759/FULLTEXT01.pdf"], "venue": "2008 Seventh International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalName": "2008 Seventh International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "121-126", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2008.107", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2008.107", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "magId": "2016026777", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

We have focused on connecting a Semantic Network Processing System (SNePS) (Shapiro & Rapaport 1992) agent to a Pyro robot, however, the framework we have developed, snarpy (an architecture linking SNePS with Pyro), is extremely flexible and allows for the integration of any formal knowledge representation, reasoning, and acting system with Pyro. Cognitive Robotics is focused on higher-level actions and perceptions rather than lower-level details of robot interaction with a world. Pyro is a Python-based environment for robotics (Blank et al. 2006; Blank, Meeden, & Kumar 2003; http://www.pyrorobotics.org ), and indeed, for cognitive robotics, that provides underlying support for a variety of actual and simulated robots by making available a large set of high-level primitives for interacting with sensors and effectors. We have built additional layers on top of Pyro so that we can use a powerful KR system, capable of reasoning and communicating about its actions as it performs them, to enhance the capabilities of Pyro agents. While our interest and investigations have to date involve using the KR system to control the robot\u2019s actions and plans, the KR component of the system could just as easily serve as an auxiliary, powerful reasoner for a Pyro agent to call upon.", "authors": [{"name": "Debra T.

Predefined strategies optimized for play against a specific opponent are not likely to succeed when employed against another opponent. Learning a strategy for each new opponent from scratch, though, is inefficient as one is likely to encounter the same or similar opponents again. We call this particular variant of inductive transfer a concept recall problem. We present an extension to AdaBoost called ExpBoost that is especially designed for such a sequential learning tasks. It automatically balances between an ensemble of experts each trained on one known opponent and learning the concept of the new opponent. We present and compare results of Exp-Boost and other algorithms on both synthetic data and in a simulated robot soccer task. ExpBoost can rapidly adjust to new concepts and achieve performance comparable to a classifier trained exclusively on a particular opponent with far more data.", "authors": [{"name": "Achim  Rettinger", "ids": ["1748257"]}, {"name": "Martin  Zinkevich", "ids": ["8195063"]}, {"name": "Michael H.

However, the fundamental concepts of rationalizability and CURB (Closed Under Rational Behavior sets have not, to our knowledge, been studied from a computational perspective. First, for rationalizability we describe an LP-based polynomial algorithm that finds all strategies that are rationalizable against a mixture over a given set of opponent strategies. Then, we describe a series of increasingly sophisticated polynomial algorithms for finding all minimal CURB sets, one minimal CURB set, and the smallest minimal CURB set. Finally, we give theoretical results regarding the relationships between CURB sets and Nash equilibria, showing that finding a Nash equilibrium can be exponential only in the size of the smallest CURB set. We show that this can lead to an arbitrarily large reduction in the complexity of finding a Nash equilibrium. On the downside, we also show that the smallest CURB set can be arbitrarily larger than the supports of the enclosed Nash equilibrium.", "authors": [{"name": "Michael  Benisch", "ids": ["2742523"]}, {"name": "George B.

Both the learning samples set and testing samples set are used, experimental results demonstrate the method based on the wavelet neural network is more efficient than the original mini-distance method", "authors": [{"name": "Guang-Yuan  Zhang", "ids": ["49288267"]}, {"name": "Jing-Jiao  Li", "ids": ["8549697"]}, {"name": "Ai-Xia  Wang", "ids": ["46991291"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["060bdd9ae1c90f26a0535fd69aa9b59285903944", "7787d80cb5cfd688ab7b72ab1d0a7389456b48f6", "2ce42d0ea68a2562bbf919b65cd73c9402674412", "5e83f3248e344befdc9d9aa5b0b4105fe0bcd1d1", "a37d100f47d2183ff2fffc088dc81f84d19a8b57", "33fed906597d971f6e086bc1372ad647f8cfda6a", "2a6c251213acdab90b9ac21a10a4b66ceb067e9a", "fdbb7aa5d2306066174ec217a5b732c91467d1f4", "693086d4ff2401aaa7a2bb2850ed9edb5aa57e3b"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/52e8cb95b94fe01ca088d4cd6bd5d45cf6c199dc", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2006 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2006 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "3339-3344", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258471", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258471", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2149421588", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

More recently, weighted satisfiability solvers have been used successfully for MPE inference in statistical relational learners (Singla & Domingos 2005). However, fully instantiating a finite first-order theory requires memory on the order of the number of constants raised to the arity of the clauses, which significantly limits the size of domains it can be applied to. In this paper we propose LazySAT, a variation of the Walk-SAT solver that avoids this blowup by taking advantage of the extreme sparseness that is typical of relational domains (i.e., only a small fraction of ground atoms are true, and most clauses are trivially satisfied). Experiments on entity resolution and planning problems show that LazySAT reduces memory usage by orders of magnitude compared to Walk-SAT, while taking comparable time to run and producing the same solutions.", "authors": [{"name": "Parag  Singla", "ids": ["35108153"]}, {"name": "Pedro M.

{"id": "d418026aa68b4840f0fbdcb491d7fa776a3fbf95", "title": "Children's Rational Exploration", "text": "Very young children have remarkably sophisticated causal knowledge about the world, yet relatively little is known about the process of causal learning. In this paper we provide a Bayesian model of how the interaction of prior theories and evidence can lead to ambiguity in competing causal hypotheses; we suggest that children seek to resolve such ambiguities through active exploration. In Experiment 1, we look at the model with respect to children\u2019s causal judgments. In Experiments 2 and 3, we show that children selectively engage in exploration when evidence is formally ambiguous with respect to their prior theories. We suggest that children\u2019s play is rational with respect to this model and that children\u2019s active exploration of causal ambiguities might generate evidence that could support theory formation and theory change. Children\u2019s Causal Reasoning Very young children have remarkably sophisticated causal knowledge about the world in a variety of domains. Children reason about the causes of mental states such as beliefs and desires (e.g. see Wellman, 1990), in the domain of physics, they reason about object properties and forces (e.g. Bullock, Gelman, & Baillargeon, 1982; Shultz, 1982) and with respect to their na\u00efve biology, they reason about causes pertaining to illness and growth (Gelman & Wellman, 1991; Kalish, 1996). Many researchers have suggested that children\u2019s causal knowledge can be characterized as intuitive theories: abstract, coherent, defeasible representations of causal structure (Carey, 1985; Gopnik & Meltzoff, 1997; Wellman, 1990; Keil, 1989). However, despite the importance of theories for children\u2019s predictions, explanations, counterfactual reasoning, and exploration, relatively little is known about the processes responsible for this kind of causal learning. Some researchers have suggested that children\u2019s naive theories might be instantiated in domain-specific modules, or innate concepts in core domains, (Carey & Spelke, 1994; Keil, 1995). For example, some researchers have argued that we have core knowledge about objects, agents, and number (Carey & Spelke, 1994). However, other researchers have emphasized the role of domain-general learning mechanisms, such as sensitivity to patterns of statistical evidence. Of the few studies that have directly compared domain-specific and domain-general causal learning, some have suggested that both adults and children privilege domain-specific information over domain-general evidence, (Ahn, Kalish, Medin, & Gelman, 1995; Bullock, Gelman & Baillargeon, 1982; Shultz, 1982). By contrast, other research suggests that children can use domain general learning mechanisms (such as the conditional probability of events) to override domain boundaries (e.g. Schulz.& Gopnik, 2004). Because previous research has focused on cases when evidence either overwhelmingly favored a domain inappropriate cause (suggesting the strength of domain general arguments), or cases when theories were strongly instantiated and little counter-evidence was available (suggesting the strength of prior theories), little work has demonstrated a graded interaction between the two. However, in previous research (Bonawitz, Griffiths, & Schulz, 2006; Schulz, Bonawitz, & Griffiths, in press), we proposed a formal model that suggested how prior knowledge and statistical updating may interact in cases when children are presented with ambiguous evidence. Our model is applicable both to cases when children have strong prior knowledge and cases when they do not. In this paper, we will argue that both domain-specific theories and statistical evidence play an important role in children\u2019s causal inferences. In particular, we will describe scenarios in which the interaction of prior knowledge and evidence leads to ambiguity between two potential candidate causes. First we will describe how ambiguity arises and is reflected in children\u2019s causal inferences. Then, we will suggest that in these cases of ambiguity, it is more optimal to explore than in cases when a single likely causal hypothesis is strongly favored. We will suggest that, although children may not construct carefully controlled experiments, their spontaneous exploration reflects sensitivity to these formal instances of ambiguity and is thus rational with respect to our model. We suggest that this sophistication in exploratory play is one mechanism that can allow children to \u2018construct\u2019 new knowledge and support the processes involved in theory change.", "authors": [{"name": "Elizabeth Baraff Bonawitz", "ids": ["2759821"]}, {"name": "Laura  Schulz", "ids": ["144877155"]}], "inCitations": ["94f0efce8909a34cba68849dfa3be816baa60aa8", "d877b76666034b088a2c9958af0dcc43b2dc68bd", "f0ec20d92e31dd94153bafeb019721d22ebe4bf9"], "outCitations": ["8c127e243ef22438d80c461d1c0bba8354647d13", "640fcb18b5107af9dc84941c8969a6a819fcf714", "7ecf4de1651f6ae28d6756ac81fe25f6f6773ac4", "235648f48e76a0147908b8f677e25e79ab39f894", "7414efb630057cf5a84701d50d749adb9a32729e", "e6a1366ec033c02f08c9ce039d0a28dd67539116", "102a4fece64958f03f055ed002358fea9b6fab7f", "20113a57ece672ae77300dd76f0b8cf2cb909fac", "5dd594a67e24b28c64f7edd104e426b4cf3717f1", "79c1de3fc0d1bbcf3b3de31551dc5cfe94b84c2d", "e7b848a4f1d52b0a0a25fa6b96b464a9eb2f0e61", "eebb0ee46f32af2eb8abab294f5040f0fb383386", "7ae29a0bcc78f411804c243433323dbf0d3b3bbe", "6fd63111355ad418a2584743a115ae33abc38af4", "91d402498d68579a9e54a7765cb3ab5b34f6f09f", "5bf397e119438501124a53ca0bf6fcf646838474", "de4aeae45868912c8dc70733c1a26b3b615872d8", "62064218665ad89f0cb2a44f5b19f7703d9c7e71", "1b749b8332a09a5ad7991fe325bbe95b5f057d5e", "b8ed896dd5d5f997cfece1b7ce4cccda2485f95c", "1c6356a688a273889fb71bab17973ed10483d97f", "4c6465c7d2c1cb5e21dc3afe61a29ab274760e63", "c18b1e99b9f75951a99a932fa8930d8d44bc586e", "74f4dded224c8fbca0ae52d47bf7ee580daf9d6a", "1115318c6ec8765fe8797b169b4d73f783bb56f5", "6c99e0f5ea53e62aed9dbe73b315e4e53a6ebea6", "d20a8d89a9100aa8f7388df41001b8e6c3183cf4", "b6c3802466cfd0c8f5c0ea91f5bae3a1257a7b39", "811a708dd3b71023550e7e112b464dd61fed9588", "a277cd08d850d81d0ca57aaca5d244966cfb7776", "4fd11b8c7d6e891ff2dcd0b22f277fda5a560e97"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d418026aa68b4840f0fbdcb491d7fa776a3fbf95", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Fall/2007/FS-07-03/FS07-03-001.pdf", "https://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/2007/fs07-03-001.php"], "venue": "AAAI Fall Symposium: Computational Approaches to Representation Change during Learning and Development", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1-8", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Psychology", "Computer Science"], "magId": "2902861974", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Most of them also store the QBF in CNF internally for reasoning. In order to use these solvers, arbitrary Boolean formulas have to be transformed into equi-satisfiable formulas in Conjunctive Normal Form by introducing additional variables. In this paper, we point out an inherent limitation of this approach, namely the asymmetric treatment of satisfactions and conflicts. This deficiency leads to artificial increase of search space for QBF solving. To overcome the limitation, we propose to transform a Boolean formula into a combination of an equisatisfiable CNF formula and an equi-tautological DNF formula for QBF solving. QBF solvers based on this approach treat satisfactions and conflicts symmetrically, thus avoiding the exploration of unnecessary search space. A QBF solver called IQTest is implemented based on this idea. Exrerimental results show that it significantly outperforms existing QBF solvers.", "authors": [{"name": "Lintao  Zhang", "ids": ["38645922"]}], "inCitations": ["a0229fb0e40ecef467aee485110ed0d5960eace4", "46ca7e80ffb8dae1912e4987cbf4dc3d79ca5c40", "d2e265e036f887d5c50c14ab2101373346f7ce00", "231449fc24310495e791f17d40954b5c16522331", "1591e565643f65836b05fbb000410281570bf0bd", "fb64734f0ff265120574e1d8e57226a444b741d9", "0808ae214092b3bab805b82bc4e76da869bdaf9d", "d4dea5d74cad6cce93fc5228893b0edf03ecb655", "0837933f420ed4001c346cf44219bcb651109b16", "4d0c444a18ae12daf673e311164c09f0116371d5", "cb0785705c913ce31de1efb22616f02850979b79", "ac888f35e88e22ab63c56fbd47805b5f2dcdd16c", "db2166992dede8cfb54d70c4de21149510320ca6", "76a21e5ee93c8f1f1b120445d1a41b9719752248", "5b8b63d7c7adae17672faecfa8c19ec71dc3cc57", "b55b555e9daacbba905262cc131570e66dcb7bc9", "e39d3141fded153348249560b4f668f731afdf02", "3ccab905e83f38d7deef7d19d49df599d7be3d08", "b6a0b2fe09b04095bf98ec58d14cec9161337baa", "4f1e50b3da855cbd1bb7ba97bcd908ffebc188aa", "210fd077acfa79ed3c4fd20f1cfeb8ee5080248c", "0267b49db922fa0f276b1ea01814748f6ad7dc51", "cdafe7de931c5fd09a757b66e36b24cb891acec3", "adb15534f4d3acc0bc5c91d92bd028f123297718", "f9ebe5dd1470e65991d47b26b9e06faca859eabc", "3ead4fe98438fc64d76353d6422a04f69fd60729", "4d9fe7cc79e9365223869aa60598f4c3a5abc9c9", "7518fe2e53cde9c9a8f8ffeebcab9d84e07405bf", "f9eb83800923b36acb43416f2ef3981c985500a5", "334ae195dc998293364bf8fd4fd528f7c75db452", "2ace1a1731a200f378fe783a74e49042108d69fd", "d624a7189c2703b0116be4c69354e9674b8278c6", "11c8c056df96ddd49414b6ed7349d537ec215755", "1d3c31225a5723a27fc8a52eb0d3b92a46380d24", "f56ee7b635486359949ac4238c170d376d58b875"], "outCitations": ["b9928d7169f201bb4fbed479e416cd3954909558", "8a53a5a254de9d86ddc54d2c16dd41cecb37615f", "2fcd2df60340088b0e5c63a32a4353cdaaadfc9f", "e56b6646882daa127ca2600fd9cbfc8917c21f97", "de0bd3d615242a31c34f09da0da14b2a4b1a85ec", "053a3a690a0b54a874bd57d854316b6e4d9481b2", "d208e1985fd2b4a5a19a5426daaed380760fb922", "66a3815b4e0fd9902f291f6bcec06b99e4fe78a1", "669bd7dcecb74b25d6cb56026544dd8e290ee5c2", "2a36654a2b451e3aebe3ab169efcfa190b644831", "71d4d693c23e4fdd8cb2e1fc67529060f3321db9", "323534b1c0a532906d3015483eb59f70e62257a3", "7e093e0b8df59f0590c832faa3e5addf7b674359", "f347dbe39f0ac42cc4942f9e0dea3c260cf97d3d", "93d81f20080019820b0b8179bb5de45b1e99a095", "476989278dbf8aec3f322b15d48f55a828f24f6e", "bc44bf63d0eca8b2bb72a378a6e7085d3b42580a", "746537c862781aab3ab2869fd276f7d8ca0d4d8d", "d1172808261e096e3e627ce89b4754f614b7917e", "9bbf565f1d3a78b360e036469c20890681dde065", "a93beb012f2bb4aa58ede0db0a30642f746fec90", "f15120bf778051cf500998e54fa95d62a09292a2", "b9491bbcd4d6be0e2221b41c08ad65d6cc43010c", "674c0d017a03c9716d490517ad1a58c72f8d9c5d"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3261a8da5e8be03ed7f6af883c3d955cd7207c93", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2006/AAAI06-023.pdf", "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/aaai_2006_ccdnf.pdf", "http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/66817/aaai_2006_ccdnf.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI 2006", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "143-149", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "138251527", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

By a special design scheme, the controller singularity problems are avoided perfectly in this approach. Furthermore, the closed-loop signals are guaranteed to be semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded and the outputs of the system are proved to converge to a small neighborhood of the desired trajectory. The control performances of the closed-loop systems can be shaped as desired by suitably choosing the design parameters.

The mixed H2/Hinfin controller with regional pole placement constraints is designed based on linear Hill's equations. The mixed H2/Hinfin controller takes into account both the disturbance rejection aspects and the LQG aspects. In addition, the closed-loop poles can be forced into some sector of the stable half-plane to obtain well-damped transient responses. The problem is reduced to a convex optimization involving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), so it can be solved efficiently. Extensive simulation studies were conducted for the validation of the proposed robust controller using Matlabtrade.

But the arcing time is very short in the operation of switchgear under real situation. In order to observe and analyze the whole process of arcing, the thesis presents a kind of visual simulation method based on arc image. Because of the strong radiation of arc, the weak reflection of contacts, and the shake of apparatus due to the impact of mechanical motion, the arc image was affected by noise during the process of switching arc image acquisition. In order to avoid the drawbacks, and to provide a clear arc image, a new type of mapping function is introduced in de-noise process which can get threshold from different scales and directions, based on the wavelet transform theory.

It is very time-consuming and difficult for actual production processes. A novel process fault detection and diagnosis technique based on principal component analysis (PCA) is presented and discussed. The proposed method reduces the dimensionality of the original data set by the projection of the data set onto a smaller subspace defined by the principal components through PCA, and the multivariate statistical process control charts, for example, Hotelling T2, Q and contribution charts are used to detect and diagnose the process faults. The monitoring performance of the proposed method to a typical continuous production process indicates that the fault diagnosis model constructed by PCA can efficiently be used to extract the main variable information of original data set independent of the process mechanism, and detect the abnormal change of the process", "authors": [{"name": "Tao  He", "ids": ["50259110"]}, {"name": "Wei-Rong  Xie", "ids": ["13184439"]}, {"name": "Qing-Hua  Wu", "ids": ["50528688"]}, {"name": "Tie-Lin  Shi", "ids": ["9308766"]}], "inCitations": ["d642df9c3005ac60e2230b6a320c462bbfc8addc", "98a0c3f34e10c88d77b52cd742f6dc9d3228348c", "3cfc19e302b9d840587bcb50a8e16fefc8a94e75", "f9e62293e5fa3b1328b5ad96da80f569a23b843c", "0c7ce73986d02fe8dc5d358c0ea98da537909773", "74cfa0649d0933afd516414950e7e2e45c30172c", "e0fea6e1c1423c9f7661c7f9712dfc58d987ef93", "adb02bd53e2786ab480190edb8b25ff84f0f8944", "b89c1c96eca7235e077f2975fdbf4c3e4905e094", "0255823a2deeaba99931d5284d2dec62548a01a2", "65e4cd08c16e81557dd507a4c7465e7615ddbacc", "192af5b408162c6101ec74c0f1d75470848f51e2", "4fba0bbaddde3470b4f63b5ea5e979be9a1140b4", "79614d175e5c237a1e9ffb68190502a45a4df930", "2ed8328007628d5614eef2f4b4de636134e1fd6d", "7bbd4cf83e80f79ce30b987890252a793158fe03"], "outCitations": ["e806c5dd705c730dadc8c438af5134f39ec0c7f6", "71e3f9abf8eed50a91c4d0006bb5b6186a73e831", "fe6bfc48a451a06bc862cbf46e1a1c0ca489600e", "4e43748355719d14a6491808da78e8718819dadd", "cb68c2b482c8dfdec1b07d3b984caeecf6674db9", "d42f33c5cb1725955569de4484f7316444f544e8", "bf8d8a6421d83e7ea0f307d52f68ae765bc4e598", "894b0dbf9a6baa8f1516dff9306c261192878613"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8b627d797a9d848a17d613c98a8544c783761510", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2006 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2006 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "3551-3556", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258550", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258550", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2102676112", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

We have developed a computer system, called Classroom Learning Partner (CLP), that supports this methodology, and we have used it in teaching an introductory computer science course at MIT over the past year. Through evaluation of controlled classroom experiments, we have demonstrated that this approach reaches students who would have otherwise been left behind, and that it leads to greater attentiveness in class, greater student satisfaction, and better interactions between the instructor and student. The current CLP system consists of a network of Tablet PCs, and software for posing questions to students, interpreting their handwritten answers, and aggregating those answers into equivalence classes, each of which represents a particular level of understanding or misconception of the material. The current system supports a useful set of recognizers for specific types of answers, and employs AI techniques in the knowledge representation and reasoning necessary to support interpretation and aggregation of digital ink answers.", "authors": [{"name": "Kimberle  Koile", "ids": ["2105944"]}, {"name": "Kevin  Chevalier", "ids": ["47090811"]}, {"name": "Michel  Rbeiz", "ids": ["48185206"]}, {"name": "Adam  Rogal", "ids": ["49858096"]}, {"name": "David  Singer", "ids": ["47373164"]}, {"name": "Jordan  Sorensen", "ids": ["46518381"]}, {"name": "Amanda Jane Coles", "ids": ["5342780"]}, {"name": "Kah Seng Tay", "ids": ["33553579"]}, {"name": "Kenneth  Wu", "ids": ["79371001"]}], "inCitations": ["bc886d48846c6b99bd54c90e8a56be6bfe5bcf7f", "10771210e95db1ae66a61a950300abc02091bb41", "11fd1dc171984d161d93bd9e7fccc6129d2997fc", "2adcdfaf6f102529df2d9eb122cc9ca355657554", "708d829241a70fecca562450f795b4361cb54481", "a98775421c76b7abdfc3df9de520c6a5983e26d2", "4c530cabc35042c259ecf665aa9abe2ddb3cb1a9", "4fa5200eab56ff500e835baa81a7bc7ce1d0e785", "244b034f616e639227f092835bb46a9b75c25ad3", "88c128229344b088e79bbfa1a67c4748344f5aed", "50d3e4dcc7c62c9e22638f381129f3a5e4c689e3", "01a62c4de6146edf694eac05ccb1b4d2352e5d5d", "904070ff9b02a73500b9c2596d5d7417488b7148", "0a48afcc2a34179ec609f11a2ccdbd1e4db8d721", "d1733435d2af57adeb8e2148d82c177ea4363d61", "a31638e8551f5471678a38a65c18894913bcab6d", "51b911c845f6d301e9edc8655da6a5de9fbfc49b", "f52f173e83dd3b501ed84e97988d107a52f02fc9", "d2cc45f215e95273d77e1440f848bfe1e90db5ed", "9c1363cc0fcb8a6a62f1ccb4c68ae9036f992e9c", "bc1aa65835b61b68c917774717488c4a3a3a46cd", "e872c871ff017eaeae6a976c82072bf25ac3cc55", "6c39c66a38ccc412f026be8feb25c1457cae7c2b", "283c74e73f039e2276773d11f2159d2a3fed99fa", "c504591eeaa8b26968c0076e01c5d0630eb94604", "575b0ee67df07976844734e0a6bca44b734be08d"], "outCitations": ["cddd9126c738ba9ff9d0ce9ab5cc9cce5a12dcce", "c5bc2537ddbc547894d0c30561629e167ab92ef8", "aecf01a12624754951e4523b3bc37de480faed81", "21b66194f9057e84abd587fb2d314a324c310f9c", "7f1d0cc5b6a1e23c6756454a8bb6a756a3f8ffde", "356badffd5002a9e4e3fee50d846fb31b2b10845", "089649bb10ab9c83be5e1ae062340dcf39abf447", "27342c53eb1838eff85223c7999e8f57479eb35e", "c0e6200fa5c64964215c9fdcad4a4a24dffbf376", "238f6ec34467b91e2122603ac5e3964f14ac737e", "17a265eacdf6cb31d25dd7978f2763a0dc8b1f17", "cdc31e0cfbf2247b3c794608e975d202d23d6c4c", "ab606d64fb476b8826a7a5c3c455318f045cae26", "394290a6e8970a0a93bb3579c724e64df05d6891", "e1f30dd5c683a1c4cc7ef3ae9e29b6f02d42501a", "6659346bb8697e25df0716d23bb5feebe50754d9"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b350e01f45f81db70152f6bd1d6ae8c93cbfbb46", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://projects.csail.mit.edu/clp/publications/documents/KoileIAAI07.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2007/AAAI07-287.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2007/aaai07-287.php"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1787-1794", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2154033797", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

We design mechanisms (both deterministic and randomized) that reach an approximately optimal decision and are strategyproof, i.e., agents are best off when they tell the truth.

While we believe such connections are an important piece in the puzzle of meaning, we argue that perceptual grounding alone does not suffice to explain the specific, stable meanings human speakers attribute to each other. Instead, human attributions of meaning depend on a process of societal grounding by which individual language speakers coordinate their perceptual experience and linguistic usage with other members of their linguistic communities. For system builders, this suggests that implementing a strategy of societal grounding would justify the attribution of bona fide linguistic meaning to a system even if it had little perceptual experience and only modest perceptual accuracy. We illustrate the importance and role of societal grounding using an implemented dialogue system that collaboratively identifies visual objects with human users.", "authors": [{"name": "David  DeVault", "ids": ["144662324"]}, {"name": "Iris  Oved", "ids": ["2591555"]}, {"name": "Matthew  Stone", "ids": ["144884556"]}], "inCitations": ["0fdbbb8f27d7ab9ee7c207f9d7217b3ad16f55d1", "e6ac6d0b7148c0b554e99b37bbd2ea5f43c51c1e", "bb6c2a64ecb6e4c9f3f5720d53cca76a2c37505d", "922cf4d4a335ab4b0b990511c4cd847c4ef4d093", "8aea5fe8a26bc6eb4733a1b3a87ac4fb29413094", "95e0ab9d3168dab15a63393776264148c2e950ba", "be5f4fb9b51f92657b7c979742204bbf6cd4dbc2", "667372b8f0c2c03d50f4fcc543b7b48e975a28aa", "74691c5f2b979c0fb12d36d38d266b5dbdca8ff6", "a29f8015a4c46188a27b52bafcc943bafb1a49ea", "c79098400ffc939fb8ad5679e6912996af6f5fe6", "1403b7a094a0487cf7c6eb6b1021fe1b30f90f0d", "1c035b35edee0cb9c9534b5fd43415ff16dd409d", "b5cd47fc7593d5d523d89f3a09846f0080471384", "180d8e56484204c85477c93317b34f5352c40b76", "9a124d1aa8d220ee60921302e9142db6b233fe87", "22f0f55e64c69c1230c526eb7d00be2fab7f8be9"], "outCitations": ["17c71f58d0353e6684075211e39d6cf5d4ad345b", "7d1b9f6eea3a4b2c973486df8681cf9723e7bb9f", "2206353fff7df60988e528bd5692f16646910d5a", "98d6a531a741964ea547f5c8533a3b65e04603d9", "0059e902765146e58542a6716b69e2993793be55", "4372980a3dddcb7669a35ed6e1e0795449b30c08", "640e47f499c8c083e57def34ca757e72106c25a0", "b11be5f8b42017704df3c180e90b8881446ba119", "567ddb4e06a88b0afeee5b12ff3e57cb9769e649", "050ee1524b25baba60b8dfd91ca6e0837238d5c9", "58aee64e8c9b23e84af6e7250d9c3afb995aefe1", "9b55ed1e9693183cc07023a4194c62cbc0364213", "8516816ef4e36da58c3fea7e285d52ce1ea9fc0e", "77f8fae0658f80ec71e560846830a1dba4dc831d", "aafd9a4fd708a837c10723f2eb78527486bde5b1", "6a222f2787607ecdb75b08e5f495fbed3c15d418", "bfa035c0e723f8f540500db038ca6e26d599029d", "b92116abb02ebc12e40be458de66407bbc7f8b93"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fd531e4720bedc0bafad42414a3dc0ca1612a497", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.research.rutgers.edu/~ddevault/publications/aaai06.pdf", "http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~mdstone/pubs/aaai06.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2006/aaai06-119.php", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2006/AAAI06-119.pdf", "http://people.ict.usc.edu/~devault/publications/aaai06.pdf", "http://athos.rutgers.edu/~mdstone/pubs/aaai06.pdf", "https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~mdstone/pubs/aaai06.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "747-754", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2111160350", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Stimuli were visually complex and unrecognizable shapes. The unlabeled examples were sampled from a bimodal distribution with modes appearing either to the left (left-shift condition) or right (right-shift condition) of the two labeled examples. Results showed that, although initial decision boundaries were near the middle of the two labeled examples, after exposure to the unlabeled examples, they shifted in different directions in the two groups. In this respect, the human behavior conformed well to the predictions of a Gaussian mixture model for semi-supervised learning.

To do this, two quality attributes, sensitivity and classification performance, are investigated, and two metrics for quantifying each of these attributes are suggested. Using these metrics, a systematic comparison has been performed between four induction algorithms on eight data sets.

{"id": "a042f58ef347ceed4a0a7d9cffbfb95c2d5111d0", "title": "The Biological Bases of Syntax-Semantics Interface in Natural Languages: Cognitive Modeling and Empirical Evidence", "text": "This paper reviews recent research on representation of events in human languages. We consider empirical evidence for event-structural analysis of language comprehension and production in spoken and signed languages, as well as possible biological bases for it. Finally, theoretical linguistic models, models of language processing, and cognitive architectures, which account for such event-structural basis of syntax-semantics (and, possibly, phonology interface in ASL) in human languages are discussed. Representation of events in human languages: linguistic universals meet language processing. The idea that human languages parse and formulate observable events in a logically restricted fashion is fairly old, dating back to Vendler\u2019s (1967) Aktionsart predicate classes (more recently developed by van Lambalgen and Hamm, 2005). Recent work by Van Valin (2007) claims that the most pervasive components of real-world events have made their way into the morphology of most of the world\u2019s languages (albeit in different form), qualifying them for the status of linguistic universals. For example, he notes that durative, dynamic, causative, and inchoative alternations surface as morphological constants in various language families; while the granularity of the system remains to be (empirically) determined, the pervasiveness of it in the linguistic data is striking. Linguistic theory of verb types has long observed universal correspondences between verbal meanings and syntactic behaviors, including adverbial modification (Tenny 2000), aspectual coercion (Smith, 1991), and argument structure alternations (Levin, 1993, Ramchand, 2008, etc.). Vendler (1967) proposed a system of four basic syntactically relevant semantic types of predicates: atelic States and Activities, and telic Achievements and Accomplishments. The telic/atelic distinction is most clearly analyzed in terms of the internal structure of events. \u2018Telic\u2019 is understood as the property of events (linguistic predicates) containing a conceptual (semantic) endpoint. In contrast, \u2018atelic\u2019 events do not contain such a point and have the potential to continue indefinitely. Atelic events are homogenous, in that they may be divided into identical intervals, each of which is an instance of the event itself, i.e. \u2018walking\u2019 as an instance of \u2018walking\u2019. Telic events are composed of at least two subevents, one of which is the final state, and are therefore heterogeneous (cannot be divided into identical intervals). The model was further developed by Pustejovsky (2001), with the primary distinction between static subevent type S(tate) and dynamic subevent type P(rocess). Vendlerian transitions were modeled as combinations of non-identical subevents: either S S (Achievements) or P S (Accomplishments). Ramchand (2008) further developed a syntax-semantics interface model of event and argument structure including three possible event phases: initiation, process, and resultant state (with corresponding argument realization), and elaborated a factorial typology of event-argument predicate constructs based on formal minimalist syntax, overtly incorporating semantic notions of durativity, resultant state/telicity, agentivity and causation into the interface. Linguistic theories beyond minimalism also converge on a similar set of semantic distinctions affecting syntax in the world\u2019s languages. For example, Dixon (2000) lists state/action, control, volition, affectedness and intention among semantic primitives involved in contrastive pairs of causal constructions across the world\u2019s languages; and Pinker (1989), in elaboration of the Grammatically Relevant Semantic Subsystem Hypothesis (GRSSH), distinguishes abstract semantic features, which affect grammar (e.g. punctual vs. durative, causation), and idiosyncratic ones (such as manner), which do not. While complete analysis of all known languages of the world with respect to their event structure is not currently feasible, additional evidence for the fundamental character of a predicate\u2019s event structure comes from psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research; an increasing body of research is supplying empirical evidence that such concepts as telicity affect the way syntactic structure is processed in human languages. For example, O\u2019Bryan (2003) showed independent effects of telicity and transitivity on response times in a word maze experiment with reduced relative clauses. The subjects were asked to complete grammatical sentences containing Object reduced relative clauses, such as \u201cThe actress awakened by the writer left in a hurry\u201d. There was a significant reaction time advantage on the preposition \u201cby\u201d for sentences with telic verbs in the relative clause, as compared to those with atelic verbs; there was also an independent advantage for the second argument in sentences with obligatorily transitive verbs (both telic and atelic). The experiment thus demonstrated independent effects of telicity and transitivity on human language processing ability. A similar study by Friedmann, Taranto, Shapiro, and Swinney (in press) compared sentences with unergative (intransitive atelic) and unaccusative (intransitive telic) English verbs using a cross-modal priming technique, and found a priming effect for nonalternating unaccusatives (obligatorily intransitive telic verbs), but not for unergatives (obligatorily intransitive atelics). Additional evidence of telicity affecting online sentence processing in spoken English was provided in an EEG study by Malaia, Wilbur, and Weber-Fox (2008), which investigated the effects of verbal telicity on the ease of syntactic re-analysis of Object reduced relative clauses. The ERP data demonstrated that subjects\u2019 recovery from garden-path effects required fewer processing resources when telic verbs were used in reduced relative clauses. The same frame alternations in atelic verbs were more difficult to process, and elicited ERP waveforms typically associated with increased difficulty of early syntactic processing and thematic role integration. Because the study controlled for other factors which could affect processing, including argument animacy, frequency of verb occurrence, and transitivity, the results were clearly due to the linguistic telicity influencing sentence processing at the syntax-semantics interface. Theoretical models which account for such empirical data range from construction grammar (Kemmerer 2006, Goldberg 1995), claiming regular correspondence between semantics and syntax in verbal constructions, to a fully developed event-structure based syntax-semantics interface (Ramchand 2008), which attempts to account for the ways regular constructions and cross-linguistically observable morphology could have developed, using the minimalist model of syntax. Psycholinguistic models of processing grammatically relevant semantic information, on the other hand, are still under development (see Kemmerer, 2006, for examples). Even less is known about emergence of grammatically relevant semantic features in the lexicon. We suggest however, that signed languages, which are more closely tied to the visual modality simultaneously the one of perception \u2013 might provide the missing link to the puzzle.

By approaching these challenges in a spirit of friendship across the sciences, it is possible to achieve transdisciplinary understanding and reap the benefits of applying different, yet complementary, forms of expertise to social robot design. In this paper, we use insights and lessons learned from our own collaborative experiences to discuss how social as well as technical and design issues are addressed in the construction and evaluation of social robots and how the boundaries between the social, natural, and applied sciences are challenged, redefined, and traversed.", "authors": [{"name": "Selma  Sabanovic", "ids": ["1746316"]}, {"name": "Marek P.

Typically there are multiple kinds of resource and each has different cost and limitation in the progress of the projects. Current existent formal methods seemed to be weak in scheduling the tasks in such large projects. Genetic algorithm has been proposed to optimize the scheduling with resource constrains.

{"id": "abd500bdd054149f74a58393cfc4dc823fcf57c7", "title": "Unsupervised Shilling Detection for Collaborative Filtering", "text": "Collaborative Filtering systems are essentially social systems which base their recommendation on the judgment of a large number of people. However, like other social systems, they are also vulnerable to manipulation. Lies and Propaganda may be spread by malicious users who may have an interest in promoting an item, or downplaying the popularity of another one. By doing this systematically, with either multiple identities, or by involving more people, malicious shilling user profiles can be injected into a collaborative recommender system which can significantly affect the robustness of a recommender system. While current detection algorithms are able to use certain characteristics of shilling profiles to detect them, they suffer from low precision, and require a large amount of training data. The aim of this work is to explore simpler unsupervised alternatives which exploit the nature of shilling profiles, and can be easily plugged into collaborative filtering framework to add robustness. Two statistical methods are developed and experimentally shown to provide high accuracy in shilling attack detection.", "authors": [{"name": "Bhaskar  Mehta", "ids": ["1937622"]}], "inCitations": ["cd8ba6e3315781058796e84d3653d6bbfbd7b543", "5da857634542a5d2e9b67158fbe2d93afc99412c", "53c310682e9208ceb957e4f8e9717bab4156a4fc", "bbcc93db772639d6f20e271e11b900cbaddb5ad1", "0d40a805d5ec52c0aa3f1b8302d6116e966483c1", "a3a2e7bfd73a6bc00c4abc07316e0d0b62ca9964", "fccf97f0f18415f797a6466ac4c7a0af0404c1ad", "52219d48ef9bc005d3bfebe4d0f27c863d88bcf7", "a75cd23492a2468a63cad8b992b484df05421c55", "0c696eb04e6a9075d88e41c508faaee25065e733", "e0b10f3b05dbce9f7cb1473274f6995d0b0eb0b6", "b985d2a059e40a378f444e1efc35797d6bfce6a5", "2570ecdb4edbae053e44e235b77a96a350129dc6", "69ba16f31a373c0568272adfda6d84d97ebeec1c", "e1d7d2bb89e98c4325ac2420e2adc9bb5302d7bc", "bdf7731188b2f01bb59e373562bb641152262b36", "74df1b208b0f0174c0b13b9c824d7ab72be80c67", "299d3abe0be35bb9cf9b1a0c20f195424fa3a5f2", "6212c2f578ffefefc93dd8371801d1bccbacf960", "357e2836df58af0006ae2b52c2e5c48715d41f67", "17b31eccc538cec8e3c32b2f2cb88809d836f013", "f2a5187f52433dd1f31cfb7fae1b7452ddb85af0", "ce7beb5139b9179008f3b1c95c85dc0170524946", "140c56877ecc10631d750d157beae81474d17dd2", "8c72c1ded641d8e413e728a55a401070dceaaa74", "305e3f4a71d79b65fb3a9aad1757f89c51b7b119", "a233173d86c168baf1ff9f859da569e80a474e2d", "64984f925d0ec6173cdace18c339aa8e83f50e75", "a84c1dd29f96ee8e44f77f262e029686ea044ae9", "28c2683b7952704c77499e051f545064c0dc09a3", "7ac3011ec5aef0210f5765677ae5b8805442a4aa", "b23e00528b027eba80b96147a94fd7e7203045d2", "be2823365e97dbfa45157b1e3bc0e7c328799e90", "1f2861b051447586b9bdcbddbf0f82319adb00c9", "dc188247f7d490dab627bf6b5984c4a8bba04c4b", "feace24cc806f4cc62696c12da4b97836de21098", "76dc0b109b155e3cd62b8186585c1988a9179d20", "5e8d3f9c86a8793f1094102a866517a3890827d3", "8eea1bbe9b00fc9b8c306c487e80781133427b3d", "2b5bebfffa57683b6730aeedf89a27d1ea805866", "e42b4348f0613202395cd97163fa1b0f1d732fed", "9adcc396b2fb620d08a8e5bf0a3d78f094c9e307", "9fdd01d6fb0eaddbc642191984d3ae24ab16b75e", "59959465446df8a9ed8d8d4e17df53b806081e3c", "3856143ee3c6d17ca3f1759d1e0528b8c20be2d6", "361505815a72fa1552e3687d55157ccc6a0e934e", "a9bac6b0c901e9c26c06ab4e30118094e0db45e4", "3961fbaf6bf84d4635adea269712426f31c90341", "7b6860f95e40c4383eebc03feb8b7622a4539f3c", "193c4499ccd2cdf4e1f51f00d8d33eeb807d6a7a", "443c6f2a3bd2f74f1f59bea2b94d455a9c7a5c23", "e21aee21fbfc68bc4142a5d0dbdc7a3fad98f92c", "88f69a013906bbed80fe8c857705e96c6e2e47f4", "a2daca76f3e9998ca42787dcade36801c59bbef8", "22d27ef066b8998be1ffce8b582fc78e5b52bd5d", "05d2208403bdf96778a826ef56f6a9be358144a7", "5d5728afe5245abe818b51739a38cf8fbf0e5e24", "ce521d64775e1680deb394bb6315aa5fcc1c4abd", "d7c432256c0e634d04116a6d72806f48f670f599", "d97a496935e3e48285ab26225698bd1ee86ca6f0", "d99e86cecef2a2a9c8c4786fa279d72157d162b5", "c532ff2058953f2e7cf622ba430ed85da057d64b", "f3006952085ee687d3135928b791a6532e3dd51e", "5605d295465e954c0b55636df59d530baab5855e", "334a17ffa386902f1b3938985e6484d48fd07ae7", "6633c0d5cf566163c01132b72430c2803ff0eb2b", "2d40928cc11ca1e07a560b06bc42656847045d8f"], "outCitations": ["25353bc78453da76e43e199a925ab54457e18ca5", "9c0465cede687e5c3b5a8502a5f0f9f8a1616ae7", "0c331de628700fb88f36e043a7bc017cf7897e4e", "33bb073a4d2605e9c8417ee23182dc2c9c4c05ef", "8087b9d501731b3044d79b3fe7e19b38d4b65a98", "cd1771ae2c44641e0fd9702ddab79ab0b5ca3167"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/abd500bdd054149f74a58393cfc4dc823fcf57c7", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2007/aaai07-222.php", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2007/AAAI07-222.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1402-1407", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "107297539", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

The event model is also utilized in identifying patterns of event/role usage that can be mapped to entity relations in the domain ontology of the application.", "authors": [{"name": "Nancy  McCracken", "ids": ["144227503"]}, {"name": "Necati Ercan Ozgencil", "ids": ["2532303"]}, {"name": "Svetlana  Symonenko", "ids": ["144116052"]}], "inCitations": ["c0cc0e7873ce207b02cfd5c430ccff58fb701c02", "1700b6c3871c61e2559e21004e7b31fff608b90d", "ea1549719f8e3638ed9e0f4b1db6aae9db78a79f", "348810484c95d5c22a0f0ca286c28852b3ce2764", "ca20d5e5882840b6828265df88407983384727ce", "df3b147b1a4c5aecf1c15e7a8095999ddd107311", "124e02d3f09d5c17f11676d81f90ca2bd6b05d2b", "04a6c66ad46bcc2f5a4aa170183dc72b8386def4", "5c3d2b688d98b1618f2987397147049140083829", "5a0326efc9c6b8b3c80f4ca6fb164406e009684b", "3b6fffcb55b2963f402eb5dd04c72bfe8c3e1aa7", "1d81cd696ae5d727d09995b8e32b9030d17197db", "8f3dd7bf25efc922349a1680cf52a9c99577d83f", "5a6f7e7a9f5dcd01f3b0f81c995e86e6847092b8", "dbd9251c5b3f7bc1d0bf9aa98bd3d48760cf11a3", "45589b1b64e2cba9f879633be5cb58d8e054cb49", "f254f031bd7c68a56cfff922f8a0665768994ef2", "cd54c02c2d84780b45f23aa5abcf9db77487ed14", "e1c216415157e35ce65a559d48c201eb299ef935", "ae531fc4da4abfab0b1f02b9906ddffee31b9301", "b44e33f9613717d93b350e2a9154f9f99a3b1c1a", "6b7ce154814ea19a643a6ce96da6e3c7e06fb943", "b7f5aaec3d00591aab9bf879b5519be20f2e6d1b", "c101dccf93080350bfbd7c92ad2484b667ac6425"], "outCitations": ["acec622ca4fb7e01a56116522d35ded149969d0a", "0ecb33ced5b0976accdf13817151f80568b6fdcb", "4f0dfaefa3a034199c1a9041a34ac9422caa7545", "d4e5e79092ece8144b887a4ed8c4102520ba1346", "68c03788224000794d5491ab459be0b2a2c38677", "a584e4b607e972783cea22daaaf1114ea94a8035", "547f23597f9ec8a93f66cedaa6fbfb73960426b1", "c274b8aac56e49e65a3827c570b2496b14429166", "cce334b44106b1e1c6d09ce0223a1743eac7014c", "25e7efa59a5cf68e0fc9401e4c6fa7b2bfe3f1ae", "031b4656032aad6699a642f62d993173b378b772"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/83c6d2d1f9bf5725e257a8c2beb11dc5b3671c58", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Workshops/2006/WS-06-07/WS06-07-003.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI 2006", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2581702097", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Recently, however, certain researchers question the necessity and the validity of the concept of equilibrium as the most important multiagent solution concept. They argue that a \u201cgood\u201d learning algorithm is one that is efficient with respect to a certain class of counterparts. Adaptive players is an important class of agents that learn their policies separately from the maintenance of the beliefs about their counterparts\u2019 future actions and make their decisions based on that policy and the current belief. In this paper we propose an efficient learning algorithm in presence of the adaptive counterparts called Adaptive Dynamics Learner (ADL) which is able to learn an efficient policy over the opponents\u2019 adaptive dynamics rather than over the simple actions and beliefs and, by so doing, to exploit this dynamics to obtain a higher utility than any equilibrium strategy can provide. We tested our algorithm on a big set of the most known and demonstrative matrix games and observed that ADL agent is highly efficient against Adaptive Play Q-learning (APQ) agent and Infinitesimal Gradient Ascent (IGA) agent. In self-play, when possible, ADL is able to converge to a Pareto optimal strategy that maximizes the welfare of all players instead of an equilibrium strategy.", "authors": [{"name": "Andriy  Burkov", "ids": ["145466078"]}, {"name": "Brahim  Chaib-draa", "ids": ["1399443272"]}], "inCitations": ["590ed72962e0f1256ae05f73c9133f91d46dd786", "127d9ae1da2e798ca3f47137a5b601c40f4b0f26"], "outCitations": ["e31d26df4c3e8652d633e2d26c2444c8a45657c9", "a69e33ce29c451655d917bf9387ed57e115fcfc7", "38d35d5581e58dca4e9458501e65c1f85ca754d5", "4b9592b1894d55366040186fa3bc9245f3cfa2cb", "460ff85b44f2e6c618d32ee57ce842d5350e4945", "05e4f9007e75d3e426ee2d6414a852e9cca8bcb2", "d6f5acc8442b4e6dedd3daf8983a70c496c6fb51", "1b18f5552423e81e743988ea414f1aa6abbf6251", "87cd286ef1e7e9bbe7dbc877e705301d9163baf6", "9c33f0b0bbfe700b7791d0377aec5508fb96a870", "86e501a730619e35712f17fbdfe783fc8250effe", "a7c183abb9b044bfbe1f09199ee970ea3a01104f"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/db54f6a3990fd2b34675ae3a777529ed7c444071", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.damas.ift.ulaval.ca/publications/BurkovChaibDraaGTDT07c.pdf", "http://www2.ift.ulaval.ca/~chaib/publications/BurkovChaibDraaGTDT07c.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Spring/2007/ss07-02-001.php", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Spring/2007/SS-07-02/SS07-02-001.pdf", "http://www.damas.ift.ulaval.ca/~burkov/papers/BurkovChaibDraaGTDT07c.pdf", "http://www.damas.ift.ulaval.ca/~burkov/papers/BurkovChaibDraaGTDT07.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI Spring Symposium: Game Theoretic and Decision Theoretic Agents", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1-7", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1514336978", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Support vector machine can study any non-linear relation, but if a group of non-distinct variables are selected as input variable set, the training time of support vector machine is lengthened and the errors become bigger. The non-linear relation of the load can be effectively explained only when a group of appropriate input variables are found. In this paper, the correlation coefficient idea is used to input variables selection of support vector machine short-term load forecasting model. The load values, which have bigger correlation coefficient with expectation output values, are chosen from effect factor sets as input variables. By mean of this method, a preferable input variables set can be gained, the correlation between the input variables and the forecasting points are bigger, and the forecasting results is more exact.

Resource discovery is a main problem in the operation of the distributed environment. This paper describes our research effort to design and implement an agent based search algorithm that allows for searching in highly dynamic network. In this algorithm, we models autonomous adaptive agents after several ecological concepts and mechanisms. The algorithm is entirely distributed, and therefore scales well with the size of the network.

Recent advances in anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have made use of the quickly spreading nature of these attacks to identify them with high sensitivity and at low false positive (FP) rates. However, slowly propagating attacks are much more difficult to detect because they are cloaked under the veil of normal network traffic, yet can be just as dangerous due to their exponential spread pattern. We extend the idea of using collaborative IDSs to corroborate the likelihood of attack by imbuing end hosts with probabilistic graphical models and using random messaging to gossip state among peer detectors. We show that such a system is able to boost a weak anomaly detector D to detect an order-of-magnitude slower worm, at false positive rates less than a few per week, than would be possible using D alone at the end-host or on a network aggregation point. We show that this general architecture is scalable in the sense that a fixed absolute false positive rate can be achieved as the network size grows, spreads communication bandwidth uniformly throughout the network, and makes use of the increased computation power of a distributed system. We argue that using probabilistic models provides more robust detections than previous collaborative counting schemes and allows the system to account for heterogeneous detectors in a principled fashion.", "authors": [{"name": "Denver  Dash", "ids": ["38669399"]}, {"name": "Branislav  Kveton", "ids": ["1681967"]}, {"name": "John Mark Agosta", "ids": ["2916311"]}, {"name": "Eve M.

Based on a multi-agent modeling and simulation approach, this paper, which is different from the existing researches, designs the interaction rules of supervision and violation, builds the evolving mechanism using genetic algorithm, and simulates the evolving process on the swarm platform. On the basis of the results of the simulation, it reach the conclusion that under the condition of ldquobounded rationalityrdquo and ldquoincomplete informationrdquo, to eliminate the violation, the supervisor must obtain almost the ldquocomplete informationrdquo of the behavior of actors, apart from making their expected revenue of obedience greater than the expected revenue of violation. A heavier punishment can accelerate the progress of the evolution.", "authors": [{"name": "Chang-Hong  Li", "ids": ["120670509"]}, {"name": "Tie  Li", "ids": ["47268430"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["9d54fdec8d7d2fec0e88969b359d0207f4c0e3e9", "a011882ae5d4efb9fd53a190007e290f04cb2f46", "5d9dd70be51c2bb12a1e9a6addd0af5dd42aed13", "476a740ca1c10df04b4a4602ef852002e9993ec8", "e9e0ffb65fb5a0f95e506d01c0eca42bfdd6a0e4", "55cc8b79182069712834a7d77161a8140d4286e9", "ce78c80efe81477e76725efd4d43c7192d8ad321"], "year": 2008, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/32431178b5080fa8a60d98c56eb42c2747905576", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "4", "journalPages": "2347-2351", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620797", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620797", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2143400108", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

For this purpose, we develop a collection of belief revision operators that employ the effect of the revision on the agent's intentions as the selection criteria. These operators are then assessed for rationality against the traditional AGM postulates. There is a large volume of work concerned with classical beliefrevision, the primary issue of which is the mitigation of the uncertainty inherent in environments in which belief revision is necessary. Traditional approaches attempt to assess the explanatory power of beliefs and utilize this as a heuristic to resolve this ambiguity. We argue that for practical reasoning systems, whose primary focus lies in the maintenance of behavior and not information, an agent's intentions provide a better guide.", "authors": [{"name": "Timothy William Cleaver", "ids": ["2770381"]}, {"name": "Abdul  Sattar", "ids": ["143756261"]}], "inCitations": ["491cb5f68620d86d90b12ec9f995e2238ead5090"], "outCitations": ["a445e8142af95d781a6cccce7889d1f2165e5eea", "1e1b7f559d95d0a48b73e859659bc587305c96b2", "2839d3bdf4e9194baf6017e6533eb1f028b95b36", "9c0381553feee0f8ab5656e7219c3458aea6496c", "8db2e486e0d6037938ff0c52a96da7d5444fce8f", "743238ac57b056a7391c85647a9f72a3c22917ff", "db097eac96dd0ce5b7874f9ae74306fac5b0b2df", "1abccf654d97f77415845b4c3a5c81288924a143", "a79e5931b7736725f1162d267c63f6e8237dbf21"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ca98f789c8ecfaa083d26064b2cb2f8abce861f9", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2007/AAAI07-006.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2007/aaai07-006.php"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "36-41", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1561211037", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

In the case where reputation is conceived as a collective process, a kind of shared voices as proposed by Conte & Paolucci, to change the reputation is not a simple task. In this paper we propose to instrument multi-agent organisation with reputation artifacts that publishes objective evaluations of the performance of the agents with respect to their behaviour within the organisation. The members of the organisation can then read these evaluations and build up their reputation of others. The artifact serves thus as an instrument that aid in the building of the reputation of the agents. The evaluation of the agents is not simply based on their obedience to norms, but also considers their pro-activeness and their contribution to the success of collective tasks that are being executed in the organisation.

However, reviewing the content of such video may be time-consuming and difficult. Our goal is to produce a \"comic book\" summary, in which a transcript is augmented with keyframes that disambiguate and clarify accompanying text. Unlike most previous keyframe extraction systems which rely primarily on visual cues, we present a linguistically-motivated approach that selects keyframes that contain salient gestures. Rather than learning gesture salience directly, it is estimated by measuring the contribution of gesture to understanding other discourse phenomena. More specifically, we bootstrap from multimodal coreference resolution to identify gestures that improve performance. We then select keyframes that capture these gestures. Our model predicts gesture salience as a hidden variable in a conditional framework, with observable features from both the visual and textual modalities. This approach significantly outperforms competitive baselines that do not use gesture information.", "authors": [{"name": "Jacob  Eisenstein", "ids": ["144154709"]}, {"name": "Regina  Barzilay", "ids": ["1741283"]}, {"name": "Randall  Davis", "ids": ["143983346"]}], "inCitations": ["f4bbe8ae0005cf757a9cfa39c27ff5abdd05d0c6", "f67a728c275926ac33a6e4d1de82aa5807c1e051", "afc05640074d494a45ebc7212d19b83bc263d9e8", "0e2072157db01ad0df192aed0bdcf944d64965a7", "232cbb22ee2e05e7681ca7cb90803db58761ed82", "65380e19efde902424c25c08860fde9c6795c703", "caab6f2deb5f2b383bcfa39e96da2ee1ec5f64aa", "baf45623a462b30339ce470a0010db185d14e735", "a1978ae1214c3106787a768ed69f4c2e5de60db5", "240f0ad5e5ef457cfaaff20b292072c97a0da07e", "e84b3114301a6449ae2f1ed7342e7ca579af95ee", "d22b8ac045ab2c7dedfe15bf5268972d27473cda", "b835dcde572fb65f4e53564a86b604b4d8c3d5f9", "516336f7243f6ee27df185d62a7cda335be71013", "0bce8253f719dea483a89602fcd0c3e2c0a0fbef"], "outCitations": ["5d98302953046ebf4d574d05db26a90db95789cc", "819a2bbd4467192dbbc9e833eb4ca6653ad791aa", "b5ed559a9726fb8427306481b16970bce75e381c", "25e0541d1151c3be6cf36a6ea8b4f884f8165250", "51a170ad3713aedf49eb0dcaf6ac771dcbe976f3", "27202cbe852df8de453f74eb1e98b823d7823923", "1807058512ae2934b2be0b43f395d8583ef67303", "6f6613ef17d3d7627adf3108ac4b3be9e0abfb6e", "de133c1f22d0dfe12539e25dda70f28672459b99", "8a5420526771bcad390172668a071829df93f8ce", "c59c9e6166ee580c35f93c874279033c0a8f47a2", "9c6653ec2e01d379a77adb61d209020d75c9505b", "55bfa843047409e18ecfd58b7e817806c975535c", "5f73f1a45e0d6ea3e3dd1b6f8b32e462cb61ea6f", "1267fe36b5ece49a9d8f913eb67716a040bbcced"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/54ed3e04f5497339356b3282e7e8a4aafd5534a6", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://rationale.csail.mit.edu/publications/Eisenstein2007Turning.pdf", "https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2007/AAAI07-139.pdf", "https://aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2007/AAAI07-139.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2007/aaai07-139.php", "http://rationale.csail.mit.edu/publications/PubBackups/Eisenstein2007Turning.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2007/AAAI07-139.pdf", "http://people.csail.mit.edu/jacobe/papers/AAAI13EisensteinJ.pdf", "http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/rationale/publications/Eisenstein2007Turning.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "877-882", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2131267764", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

A memory variable structure (MVS) control is proposed for the robust stabilization of uncertain linear input-delay system with matching parametric perturbations.

Intuitively, representation change plays a key part in this process, because changes in representation allow us to model how the world works, organize information into comprehensible units, and identify pertinent information so that we can ignore irrelevant details. To develop models of human learning that account for representation change, we must first identify classes of representation change commonly encountered during learning and development, analyze how mechanisms for representation change might interact with other mental processes, and identify cognitive constraints that might lead to representation change. Based on this analysis, we can then move toward identifying key components that a computational model for human representation change would require and analyzing the validity of current approaches within this context. In this paper, I identify representation changes observed during human learning and development, suggest a working model of how representation change mechanisms might interact with other cognitive subsystems, and suggest computational mechanisms that might account for the types of representation change observed in humans.

A grounding grid is excited between couples of touchable nodes by a current source. Some voltages of touchable nodes are measured in each excitation. Minimizing the energy of the error between testing voltages and evaluation voltages is used as the index. The designed values of branches are used as the initial values. A Tabu list is formed for the branches. In each step of iteration, the resistance of each branch is increased and decreased with a certain value, respectively, forming a set of neighborhood. The aspiration criterion and stop criterion are adopted. An experimental grounding grid with sixty branches is used as an example to show the feasibility of the proposed approach.

This paper describes how the Companions cognitive architecture uses analogical model formulation to learn to solve AP Physics problems. Our system starts with some basic mathematical skills, a broad common sense ontology, and some qualitative mechanics, but no equations.

While distributed POMDPs capture the real-world uncertainty in multiagent domains, they fail to exploit such locality of interaction. Distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) captures the locality of interaction but fails to capture planning under uncertainty. In previous work, we presented a model synthesized from distributed POMDPs and DCOPs, called Networked Distributed POMDPs (ND-POMDPs). Also, we presented LID-JESP (locally interacting distributed joint equilibrium-based search for policies: a distributed policy generation algorithm based on DBA (distributed breakout algorithm). In this paper, we present a stochastic variation of the LID-JESP that is based on DSA (distributed stochastic algorithm) that allows neighboring agents to change their policies in the same cycle.

A key challenge in building a dynamic link analysis workflow environment is representing the behavior of the individual link analysis algorithms being composed. In this paper, we outline techniques for modeling algorithms that allow a system architecture to reason about their behavior and performance, individually and in combination. The algorithm characterization model we propose is based on a layered approach, where the layers range from high-level qualitative descriptions of algorithms to detailed statistical descriptions of their effect on the data. Recent research and development in technology for intelligence analysis has produced a large number of tools, each of which addresses some aspect of the link analysis problem\u2014the challenge of finding events, entities, and connections of interest in large relational data sets. Software developed in recent projects perform many diverse functions within link analysis, including detecting pre-defined patterns (Boner 2005; Coffman, Greenblatt, & Marcus 2004; Piochet al. 2004; Wolvertonet al. 2003), learning these patterns of interest (Holder et al. 2005), classifying individuals according to group membership (Adibi & Chalupsky 2005) or level of threat (Macskassy & Provost 2005), resolving aliases for individuals (Davis et al. 2005), identifying neighborhoods of interest within the data, and others. While these tools often perform complementary functions within the overall link analysis space, there has been limited success getting them to work together. One-time integration efforts have been time-consuming to engineer, and lack flexibility. To address this problem, a recent focus of research has been to link these tools together dynamically, through workflows composed by Grid software (Deelman et al. 2003), a blackboard system (Corkill 2003), or some other intelligent System Architecture (SA). One key challenge in building this kind of dynamic link analysis workflow environment is representing the behavior of the individual link analysis algorithms being composed. In this paper, we outline techniques for modeling algorithms that meet the requirements in the domain of link analysis.

Decision making under uncertainty conditions is one of the main problems in multi-agent systems. Uncertain and stochastic factors affect the performance of the action and make the agent unable to take the appropriate task. A high complexity of such environment causes decision making on the basis of traditional method (hard code) to be absolutely difficult, so new approaches of decision making such as Markov decision process (MDP) and neural networks are used. In our research, the soccer 3D simulation is used as a test bed for multi-agent systems. In this paper, the Markov decision process is used as a strategy for decision making of soccer 3D agents, and also a novel policy is proposed in our MDP method. The simulation results are used for performance evaluation of our proposed approach in comparison with traditional method in situations that agents' sense/act abilities have a lot of noise involved, the simulation results show that in our MDP method, the agents make better decision and carry out better action which help to reach the goal of plan.", "authors": [{"name": "M.N.

Instead of modeling each component system in isolation and then manually crafting interaction protocols, this approach starts with a model of the collective population as a single system.

The resulting system is both globally responsive by virtue of a team oriented interaction model and locally responsive by virtue of a distributed approach to planning as well as model-based fault detection, isolation, and recovery.", "authors": [{"name": "Anthony  Barrett", "ids": ["145868650"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["9b28b296a0225049d241cfe0ff1b39d7a14f68da", "bee2ea1490075ddbc3ac1573896efe3d28ad827b", "9840b7a2c9088a8ee4506e0bf49300055352a1ae", "6920f779832116e9c0c4f56a917ecb4f98adb1a1", "a46eb182303946d7dc79b12e3aaeadbb0b7f0800", "6d5d638a72472f8f351762a595f06d39ad1517e4", "95edfb5f088b6de7239896b03dc69908b52b015e", "91da6cccb1802257a98126a41d90c9d91c23c0a9", "7e7106d1bc7d06dcaf193b9ae5485b70fbd4235c", "47288dedc6f33d262cf3bd653f1987d8626c8061", "7bf1da3a88d8671d7984adb3348c2570332ff2de", "5fb7ce660cb080a28b31c9b65a9f1dbf7a48e5af", "0bfa40fe50255a42cac34c3223871fec2239f4e4", "a8e3a1871f50ebd5e3c457bbe1a0c72c4655cee9", "d494313fbd0adc03e9a615eba46b29aa4e6fb5ce"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/89cd9481e150d68324c1a2de99dad80341903c7e", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Fall/2006/FS-06-07/FS06-07-002.pdf", "http://planning.jpl.nasa.gov/public/papers/barrett_aaaifallsymp06_teams.pdf", "http://www-aig.jpl.nasa.gov/public/papers/barrett_aaaifallsymp06_teams.pdf", "http://ai.jpl.nasa.gov/public/papers/barrett_aaaifallsymp06_teams.pdf", "https://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/2006/fs06-07-002.php", "https://planning.jpl.nasa.gov/public/papers/barrett_aaaifallsymp06_teams.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Fall/2006/FS-06-07/FS06-07-002.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI Fall Symposium: Spacecraft Autonomy", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "11-18", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2902397999", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

In this paper we describe a GGP agent that instead uses a Monte Carlo/UCT simulation technique for action selection, an approach recently popularized in computer Go.

Sequence learning is a fundamental problem, which covers a wide area of research topic including, e.g. handwritten character recognition or speech and natural language processing. For this, one may compute feature vectors from sequence and learn a function in feature space or directly match sequence using methods like dynamic time warping. The former approach is not general in that they rely on sets of application-dependent features, while, in the latter, matching is often inefficient or ineffective. Our method takes the latter approach, while providing a very simple and robust matching.

It was shown that SP estimates marginals over covers, using joker states to represent clusters of configurations. The SP-y algorithm generalizes SP to work on the Max-SAT problem, but the cover interpretation of SP does not generalize to SP-y. Recently, a relaxed survey propagation (RSP) algorithm has been proposed for inference in Markov random fields (MRF). RSP for MRFs assigns zero probability to joker states, and hence the cover interpretation is also inapplicable. We adapt RSP to solve Max-SAT problems, and show that it has an interpretation of estimating marginals over covers violating a minimum number of clauses. This naturally generalizes the cover interpretation of SP.

{"id": "cbd363583f9868b4cd44e5da806c238b20d44a46", "title": "Toward understanding children's and adults' encounters with social robots", "text": "While the design of social robots, has engaged researchers for some time, only recently have the human implications of interaction with such robots been considered. In this paper, we address how children and adults behave toward and think about the social robot AIBO. Our work is informed by a conceptual framework that draws on constructs within cognitive psychology: the essentialist theory of cognitive development and scripts. At the same time, our research challenges assumptions of both the essentialist theory of cognitive development and scripts and argues for a more dynamic and complex formulation of these constructs. Four studies of children and adults interacting with AIBO conducted by our research team serve to illustrate aspects of this framework. We close by suggesting further questions raised by this work. Reeves and Nass (2002) have proposed that \u201cindividuals\u2019 interactions with computers, television, and new media are fundamentally social and natural, just like interactions in real life\u201d (p. 5 authors\u2019 emphasis). The new media of social robots are of special interest in this regard, since they particularly evoke social and affective human responses (Breazeal, 2003; Fong, Nourbakhsh, & Dautenhahn, 2003; Lee, Park, and Song 2005). In this paper, we suggest a conceptual framework for understanding human responses to social robots in general, and to the social robot AIBO, in particular. This conceptual framework draws on the constructs of the essentialist theory of cognitive development, particularly as elaborated by Susan Gelman (2004) and her colleagues, as well as the construct of cognitive script (Shank and Abelson 2002). However, it places these ideas within a dynamic constructivist systems perspective (Melson, forthcoming) in which individuals construct the meaning of human-robot interactions over time as they experience these interactions. The resulting \u2018constructions,\u2019 evident in behavior, cognitions, and emotions related to the social robot, are the product of individual human and robot characteristics and history as well as the context and history of interaction. Hence, like all dynamic systems, HRI properties are emergent and not fully determined a priori. A Framework for Understanding Human Responses to Social Robots Essentialist Theory of Cognition In the essentialist theory of cognition (Gelman 2004), once an object is identified as belonging to a particular domain, essentialist beliefs lead one to infer \u2018essences,\u2019 i.e., distinct unseen properties that reflect the underlying nature that imparts category identity. For example, five year olds will infer bones as internal parts of an unfamiliar object labeled as an \u201canimal\u201d but batteries as internal parts of an unfamiliar object labeled as a \u201cmachine\u201d (Gottfried and Gelman 2005). Thus, a key feature of the essentialist view of cognitive development is category assignment. When encountering an unfamiliar social robot, individuals ask themselves (usually unconsciously): \u201cWhat type of object is this?\u201d The answer to this question allows one to infer unseen category attributes (e.g., if a computer like machine, it probably has batteries or power source, microchips, and sensors). However, essentialist theory assumes ontologically a limited and presumably fixed number of broad essences\u2014biological, psychological, or artifactual\u2014into which one slots unfamiliar objects. In this sense, essentialist theory divides its ontology into predetermined Platonic categories. To forecast our argument, encounters with social robots may challenge such an ontological accounting, showing evidence of category boundaries that shift, blur, and overlap. Sociable robots may prompt humans to construct new ontological categories to make sense of their interactions with them.", "authors": [{"name": "Gail F.

The results suggest that the model can discern between the beauty in chess problems where aesthetics is more prominent and over-the-board games where it is not. Implementation of the model into a computer program could therefore lead to the automatic detection of aesthetic mating combinations in chess that will be of interest to humans, particularly chess players and problem composers.", "authors": [{"name": "Mohammed Azlan Mohamed Iqbal", "ids": ["123698870"]}], "inCitations": ["faf2eae6f9bfffb0554100fb871b64c76a5c8c34", "d59d85fcbd26a1c65be80ff7b2e0a71449785d59", "04f179a1af1bae9337e63c721c56d85b899001eb", "574824df46784ba75733ca8e34638bac9c426f88", "d495b509a7c6779f0e1e052289b4b4a0509d25d5"], "outCitations": ["312ac6ec9cadd20552233e03ab169e1cadfa853e", "c153eff6e66e507372888c3374fe2381821d8fe8", "1f0224ccd25e9e3ace49f948fbb776bca937d0c8", "2a2f406d9a8d78bb9355775ac2acd143237cd69e", "1a6eacdbf4e881a91cf6b76a9f70f53ccc290ae1", "b3239c4328678e032b088a35a655970e83f739f0", "1bd226919c4a46a5823d9562ca13bef5cc591ed7", "deb15cad5b533c52bd48896cb4247a706c6d2c1b"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dcf2c54f0954ba02d2b20fda064c044491888851", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Workshops/2006/WS-06-04/WS06-04-004.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI 2006", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "16-22", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2782877159", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

However, the captured images often contain photometric and geometric distortions when the documents are of non-planar shapes, which cause significant problems to various document image analysis (DIA) tasks such as OCR. In this paper, we propose a restoration framework that removes both photometric and geometric distortions in smoothly warped document images to facilitate human perception and machine recognition. First, the photometric distortions are corrected by separating the shading image from the reflectance image using inpainting and surface fitting techniques. Next, a 2-pass Shape-from-Shading (SFS) method is exploited to recover the document's surface shape based on the extracted shading image. Once the document's shape is obtained, the geometric distortions are rectified through a physically-based flattening process. Experiments on real document images show the performance of each sub-task and demonstrate a complete solution to the restoration of physically-distorted document images.", "authors": [{"name": "Li  Zhang", "ids": ["50082014"]}, {"name": "Andy M.

A robot may tour an environment, gathering information every hour. In a wireless sensor network, these tours correspond to packets being transmitted. In these settings, we are often faced with resource restrictions, like energy constraints. The users issue queries with certain expectations on the answer quality. Thus, we must optimize the tours to ensure the satisfaction of the user constraints, while at the same time minimize the cost of the query plan. For a single timestep, this optimization problem is NP-hard, but recent approximation algorithms with theoretical guarantees provide good solutions. In this paper, we present a new efficient algorithm, exploiting dynamic programming and submodularity of the information collected, that efficiently plans data collection tours for an entire (finite) horizon. Our algorithm can use any single step procedure as a black box, and, based on its properties, provides strong theoretical guarantees for the solution. We also provide an extensive empirical analysis demonstrating the benefits of nonmyopic planning in two real world sensing applications.", "authors": [{"name": "Alexandra  Meliou", "ids": ["2283085"]}, {"name": "Andreas  Krause", "ids": ["145343838"]}, {"name": "Carlos  Guestrin", "ids": ["1730156"]}, {"name": "Joseph M.

The paper first describes a hybrid approach that incorporates PCA and Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FDA) for microarray classification. This hybrid approach effectively solves the singular scatter matrix problem caused by small training samples. To increase the effective dimension of the projected subspace the use of MDA instead of FDA is explored. To improve the performance of the system the data is projected to several subspaces incrementally. The resulting incremental hybrid system improves the accuracy of classification. The paper discusses a comprehensive evaluation of the hybrid systems. The hybrid systems were tested on a dataset of 62 samples (40 colon tumor and 22 normal colon tissue). The results show that the use of incremental hybrid system increased the accuracy of classification of microarray data which will lead to better diagnosis of cancer and other diseases.", "authors": [{"name": "M.

However, mining all the frequent itemsets will lead to a huge number of itemsets and numerous redundant association rules. Fortunately, this problem can be cured by mining only frequent closed itemsets (FCIs), which results in a much smaller number of itemsets. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to find FCIs when the database becomes too large to allow a memory-resident representation. In this paper, a methodology called hierarchical partitioning is proposed for dividing the database into a set of multi-leveled sub-databases of manageable sizes to fit into memory. The advantage of hierarchical partitioning is that the FCIs can be found directly from sub-databases without rescanning the original database for support and subset checking.", "authors": [{"name": "Fan-Chen  Tseng", "ids": ["49808740"]}], "inCitations": ["5474c2aced9ca207d50e446591a73c18eb0489ab"], "outCitations": ["0b16a74fdde23f57d568693028fb75042065a459", "e8d88bb7d1141539224cb94d3ab6eda3fd1dfa0b", "2965cf039497d78fb2ac5b3eeeac26be1d399bca", "7c7f2e57822817bcccf2becfca80c8f0f8aaf027", "0c6df8790787fada031058f4d93b50fa5e6c1895", "be6bb2408cee073f8157c8b5aa3e3f65c3e5e698", "69602bc12d17d84fa1a9b146826545e6fd03b15e", "bf7bd31b5b13e02b1e9155cf20e807954abcd95f", "90d6b1f7d2b2f93f261a2ff9e13441d21cc60bca", "22fcc2d2aeb5707498d144e80f926b1ea3bed6d5", "85221f62ae3fc4e69ef249a94b875eb6d64a2899", "6a85dd044f90e4d538e3dab12ed4bf95bb31c895", "a1e94c0fb725ec9f015ca69e6061010a603b45e1", "c055445c36a0950a20e4fbe6f3d737dc59403730", "e20e2e3d81d6a3c2ad8904774d2646a31dd77c92"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/27f9d03b50c0ed976b8ff19121ded9effd4b23be", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "4", "journalPages": "1832-1837", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370446", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370446", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2152307798", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

While these proposals allow for evaluating object-level arguments and counterarguments, they do not give sufficient consideration to evaluating the proponents of the arguments. Yet in everyday life we consider both the contents of an argument and its proponent. So if we do not trust a proponent, we may choose to not trust their arguments. Or if we are faced with an argument that we do not have the expertise to assess (for example when deciding whether to agree to having a particular surgical operation), we tend to agree to an argument by someone who is an expert. In general, we see that for each argument, we need to determine the appropriateness of the proponent for it. So for an argument about our health, our doctor is normally an appropriate proponent, but for an argument about our investments, our doctor is normally not an appropriate proponent. In this way, a celebrity is rarely an appropriate proponent for an argument, and a liar is not necessarily an inappropriate proponent for an argument.

Co-clustering the related objects often generates better clusters. One basic connection here is that the similarity among the objects of one type is often affected by the cluster structures on the objects of the other types. Although many co-clustering schemes have been proposed, none has explicitly explored such a connection. We propose a framework that utilizes this connection directly. In this framework, employing a spectral-embedding- based approach, we first obtain certain approximate cluster information about the objects of individual types. Such information is then used to refine the similarity measures for the objects of the related types. The final clustering is performed with the refined similarity. We tested our framework on both bipartite-graph and document clustering. Our experiments showed that the refined similarity leads to much better clustering, indicating that our refinement makes the similarity measures closer to their true values.", "authors": [{"name": "Jian  Zhang", "ids": ["47538892"]}], "inCitations": ["02cac4a16469d2dc3fa9678d716a56ecbf7da361"], "outCitations": ["4c40a70108c295ecc815ce1ebd73a7f2a0bf1cb2", "6c63c06cdf55e3a08c5e6576cbf1d997a2a64ce7", "e00ece3bf0058d288d7a7f17323b3cd969216cc1", "c02dfd94b11933093c797c362e2f8f6a3b9b8012", "787df8156a928e3153df8f5752d188933c5641eb", "09036439c33d38aa46cb8b6bbfbf5ad82f1cc852", "38b3a4447a47a6a6ed1869f3da03352c487f8fe3", "edde9337e61139fa3b24aac3dd685d33d6184650"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b27106b3878ee91c16ecc1982d7da9b8f696d751", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.csl.sri.com/users/zhang/coclustering.pdf", "http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2007.77"], "venue": "Sixth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA 2007)", "journalName": "Sixth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA 2007)", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "381-386", "doi": "10.1109/icmla.2007.77", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/icmla.2007.77", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

The typical MANET routing protocols of IETF are shortest routing protocols, that is, the least hops but do not consider the energy aware problem. Because the ad hoc network is an energy constrained system with the portable devices, it is a very important metric to evaluate the routing protocols whether which have a longer network lifetime or not. Based on the mobile node energy level and using the different forward tactics, this paper presents an energy level based routing protocol - ELBRP. The routing protocol not only makes the system energy consumption low but also prolongs the system lifetime and improves the delay characteristic. In this paper, the proof of correctness and complexity analysis of ELBRP are given. This paper compares the performance of existing protocols AODV, RDRP and proposed ELBRP via simulation. The simulation result shows that ELBRP has a better delay performance, a lower energy consumption and longer network lifetime than the other two and provides an available approach to ad hoc networks routing.", "authors": [{"name": "La-Yuan  Li", "ids": ["2608531"]}, {"name": "Feng  Zheng", "ids": ["144513293"]}, {"name": "Chun-Lin  Li", "ids": ["120670570"]}, {"name": "Pei-Yan  Yuan", "ids": ["49932610"]}], "inCitations": ["6cd6c2e85d1a3f27df34e0dcac0186aeae51ba85", "d5889b0cc204c4c209053ed2351f021763d14ae4", "155339896effc87f0b7196ef56a0611f3434a1c6", "3dbf5668e95b86f3bdfbf113f52e58759cf5ddfc", "f02145c07dd2733462a9156cf7da31ca883b1845", "9e66af97b6cc607da6b961f3fbe4e4b6ec950e3a", "19bfdd39d03647c155ed1ec2d539be6c3c92192c", "baadafd77e0da3aecf2e23168e23f95c6df7214c", "5cbe231389f8772fabd661c5502991b1dae9afaf", "95bd03f9c228cd9d3298796384f79f5039c332ea", "fc0334134afc3e943a07e2c8cd89f15c8da2b550", "0d051abd172412a395b939f118f033a905aa872b"], "outCitations": ["9651d64322b1e63b97b9bb1f60e2223dbe959f04", "5d7bf0e8a43e207bb85104c6fd3ce6846b6f992f", "4e9588b0f9af86c3f2c4017865bd0899916dff58", "8ff69102fb2487f451922b8dff89b8ff5989dcfd", "9e620de5b958dea6e3694ab2f8d5ce7799395a2e", "0d4511c0ba8ecfa49c7fd0a68ee81dc56dfc835c", "cc7f5307bacd04b9d2914e30e1428398f6a98db4", "c5bb62bd70cd64350430a8e1ec3889f3d73d07c8", "f532baf3c1b9d3904d7877fbc75a1bef72b3603f", "043aad97a9613d597ceac8e98fde10a58ef29d65", "7d3f0b496f42bbb81821f624e71e3385c8362a92", "720062517d9ce13cc102ec214bdaf8b8724446d0"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ee12686c3a402c9571e56d4109d4943e4518b113", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "6", "journalPages": "3205-3210", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370700", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370700", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2118194447", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Training data consists of natural language sentences annotated with multiple potential meaning representations, only one of which is correct. Such ambiguous supervision models the type of supervision that can be more naturally available to language-learning systems. Given such weak supervision, our approach produces a semantic parser that maps sentences into meaning representations. An existing semantic parsing learning system that can only learn from unambiguous supervision is augmented to handle ambiguous supervision. Experimental results show that the resulting system is able to cope up with ambiguities and learn accurate semantic parsers.", "authors": [{"name": "Rohit J.

The nonlinearity of backward propagation neural network (BPNN) is used to improve the traditional random number generator (RNG).

So, a novel and secure RNG architecture is proposed in the presented paper, which is BPNN based on SHA-2 (512) hash function. The quality of random number generated by this proposed architecture can well satisfy the security of cryptographic system according to results of test suites standardized by the U.S. The proposed architecture can be used to improve performances such as power consumption, flexibility, cost and area in network security and security for cryptographic systems.", "authors": [{"name": "Bang-Ju  Wang", "ids": ["9071524"]}, {"name": "Hong-Jiang  Cao", "ids": ["31100272"]}, {"name": "Yu-Hua  Wang", "ids": ["47906129"]}, {"name": "Huan-Guo  Zhang", "ids": ["4332415"]}], "inCitations": ["4ba561c5d0d16b8f873bf22b8a438dbc4ce90dbc", "fabdb6f0f365a201ebeed180922ddcd6b67832c8", "52957910bb20d6e885dd483372245d32dcb28515", "3461296ab4fdda4e5d51a4756031e82ef8ad2775", "91c2f56ab4849944740bfbb2f2054c9798fb4dbb"], "outCitations": ["219b74d33c941b9643d2cf2624c6754f8752c2d0", "61f7a2593b323f3ecdf1a556d83c614a9995cb08", "dce859b1dd7860c9269a0a7782f34f2ff5402424", "244cc34dc88de9c1665c36a47247144962ae53d9", "b7ca2115489f685c705242b830badc1188cb46e4", "88e99b4aa9b227cbe86b37c48e0f11c1505ef4f9", "e86c7a7b849429d77762c52de6f8940885743daf", "dc1b8af9256fa3a850a96b85d16889a3b42dc03b", "31b9134437687177e511a53ab2d4d18391a22211", "95cd29e1366b56c2efa3eb0e8e89351039e404e0", "e9f2c09aec09ddb08ee63317ac182174f35a38a4", "e3376ad0120d8c20431f47ab7cfaa8a25924e5bc", "26a9611ae5380901821a35cdbfbdd6f16b3a161b", "4c1c4c9030c142b99aadcd181a7a1c89730a277b", "063bc5362ae48a5ee5c99a772be0b41ebf5646cf", "b4f616d26b6abdb230973cee04a59fa035f476fc"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6839d204214b1d158d560e23cd5a4e9336e93fd5", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "5", "journalPages": "2708-2712", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370607", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370607", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2103766630", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

One of the central tasks in mining data streams is that of identifying outliers which can lead to discovering unexpected and interesting knowledge, which is critical important. To effectively mine outliers in data stream, ODABK, an algorithm for outlier detection in data stream is presented.

In general, the optimal alignment can be obtained through the optimization of an objective function. However, such an optimization task is often computationally intractible, most of the existing alignment tools thus use statistical or machine learning based methods to avoid direct optimizations. In this paper, we develop a new method that can progressively construct and update a set of alignments by adding sequences in certain order to each of the existing alignments. In particular, each of the existing alignments is modeled with a profile hidden markov model (HMM) and an added sequence is aligned to each of these profile HMMs. The profile HMMs in the set are then updated based on the alignments with leading alignment scores. We performed experiments on BaliBASE benchmarks to compare the performance of this new approach with that of other alignment tools. Our experiments showed that, by introducing an integer parameter that controls the number of profile HMMs in the set, we are able to efficiently explore the alignment space and significantly improve the alignment accuracy on sequences with low similarity.", "authors": [{"name": "Jia  Song", "ids": ["47163952"]}, {"name": "Chunmei  Liu", "ids": ["35106248"]}, {"name": "Yinglei  Song", "ids": ["1732766"]}, {"name": "Junfeng  Qu", "ids": ["40451877"]}, {"name": "Gurdeep S.

In several application domains, an explanation of the classifier's reasoning is critical for the classifier's acceptance by the end-user. We describe a framework, ExplainD, for explaining decisions made by classifiers that use additive evidence. ExplainD applies to many widely used classifiers, including linear discriminants and many additive models. We demonstrate our ExplainD framework using implementations of naive Bayes, linear support vector machine, and logistic regression classifiers on example applications. ExplainD uses a simple graphical explanation of the classification process to provide visualizations of the classifier decisions, visualization of the evidence for those decisions, the capability to speculate on the effect of changes to the data, and the capability, wherever possible, to drill down and audit the source of the evidence.

This approach could be particularly effective if users from across the world could create these cultural sims and allow them to be collected into an accessible global cultural experience exchange. The advances in computer game technology and readily available tools for creating environments can easily provide such playgrounds for cultural exchange; however, the largest impasse currently exists in the lack of easily accessible and usable tools for creating interactive characters\u2014 especially ones that can reflect the desired culture. The current state of the art in developing agents for simulations involves complex programming, advanced graphical building interfaces, and leveraging an information poor environment to produce canned, specialized interactions targeting usually narrowly defined scenarios with few potential outcomes. The DASSIEs (Dynamic Adaptable Super-Scalable Intelligent Entities) project aims to change this by presenting a new agent development tool and highly configurable agent core aimed for use by the common person\u2014one that everyone would be able to use effectively. We leverage a Behaviorbased Architecture defined within Brookian-based Subsumption as a base for layered and hierarchical behavior descriptions with an agent description language that translates under its defined framework these concepts for use in simulation based agents. We present our pilot work on the CULTURE (Culture Understanding and Learning Tool Using Real-world Examples) project that provides a framework for developing cultural scenarios leveraging the agent builder and agent core from the DASSIEs Project. Results from our initial user trials, and an in-lab case study modeling the culture of a Parisian Cafe will be presented with the lessons learned from the process.

This enhancement applies to the low resourceful on-board Machine Vision environment for the important surveillance applications. The overall memory consumption of the on-board codec's processor is lowered maximally by 20 percent with the use of the Precinct Partition strategy. Resolution prioritized progression ordering mode enables the immediate on-ground preview with undersized image reconstruction. Moreover, when coding larger aerial image's Region of Interest (ROI), JPEG 2000 with its layered architecture outperforms SPIHT. Using the average layer thresholds, a sequence of different aerial images can be reconstructed at the same quality. Exploring JPEG 2000 part II, i.e. 3-D Hyperspectral image coding concepts, the evaluated new parameter PSNR(ROI) (db) per band for mean bit rate of JPEG 2000 has a 5.7 percent gain over that with SPIHT. Despite its many powerful features, JPEG 2000 still lacks the directional detail filtering capability, hence, the inefficiency in curvilinear-edge reconstruction due to its inherent wavelet transforms based codec. Therefore, the novel Advanced Directional-Wavelet Packet Transform (ADWPT) is proposed for JPEG 2000, and implemented in pre-coding experiments giving a more competent curvilinear-edge coding performance than that with the existing transforms.", "authors": [{"name": "A.

Good state abstractions are compact, reuseable, and easy to learn from sample data. This paper combines and extends two existing classes of state abstraction methods to achieve these criteria. The first class of methods search for MDP homomorphisms (Ravindran 2004), which produce models of reward and transition probabilities in an abstract state space. The second class of methods, like the UTree algorithm (McCallum 1995), learn compact models of the value function quickly from sample data. Models based on MDP homomorphisms can easily be extended such that they are usable across tasks with similar reward functions. However, value based methods like UTree cannot be extended in this fashion. We present results showing a new, combined algorithm that fulfills all three criteria: the resulting models are compact, can be learned quickly from sample data, and can be used across a class of reward functions.", "authors": [{"name": "Alicia P.

To better understand and identify the hardest binary CSPs, in this work we propose methods to increase their hardness by increasing the balance of both the constraint language and the constraint graph. The balance of a constraint is increased by maximizing the number of domain elements with the same number of occurrences. The balance of the graph is defined using the classical definition from graph theory. In this sense we present two graph models; a first graph model that increases the balance of a graph maximizing the number of vertices with the same degree, and a second one that additionally increases the girth of the graph, because a high girth implies a high treewidth, an important parameter for binary CSPs hardness. Our results show that our more balanced graph models and constraints result in harder instances when compared to typicaI random binary CSP instances, by several orders of magnitude. Also we detect, at least for sparse constraint graphs, a higher treewidth for our graph models.", "authors": [{"name": "Carlos  Ans\u00f3tegui", "ids": ["2170858"]}, {"name": "Ram\u00f3n  B\u00e9jar", "ids": ["1753023"]}, {"name": "C\u00e8sar  Fern\u00e1ndez", "ids": ["144581582"]}, {"name": "Carles  Mateu", "ids": ["145665447"]}], "inCitations": ["2d7764fe95514ea4ad7df06060ee8a9e252108a0", "8e4d93bb8bc0d78c7d00a33f91f2681a37c1815f", "605ea54ae3cef77f127d65c3f0088332e7aecf1b", "5ee7861bfb89a3ccd66d74caa08f49536717eb67", "4fc6022dab1aebe2128c38cdc53c34cf99bda5af", "e7dea989b9fe257abd5d8f8e5b02df256617b655", "538c13a3434d525fe49f6df1d3aded42e8603e31"], "outCitations": ["443ed3fb7612085392ab3a639b7b70308f4aa913", "169c57d63d3dc7d51a19cd9426c552515801cf86", "fd9c949b43373e1af7387c143612f91090c6cfad", "ff44ef88ceb1bad746f662e997383bfe4e23b9a6", "e55d5295f2f26d14c1abda07b96bce62a8591822", "53c3d54167cc43c948ffa0c9d5c6c7991acf721b", "b5d3077b1611fb514ae5bcdefed5dbb77ecd2ed6", "681fd5a10b0573b0a0780079ea1e400a2cf5870e", "310f37870862a778e04c454e6552c0019c4cf6d7", "a2967053ead9e2eb9fe810adb181169abec064d7", "041bbdf11c0534043458894470f05453e12361d1", "7eef6782b88a59901749f0ee1d249111bbcf9572", "844424607135b74cea28d44b3d23c34f32d2c320", "58acdd63ab0ad0f92e8ba39a3271d42226b90f4f", "b9da2a6f3abe425c712715c5fa73885707e6b2b5", "5f043ef56cc24b1ddc63525f7095346a899aa64d", "a11cdaa94e777b0d9752a326224f742aa3f71c3b", "91b6966165cbae65e87f7476f7354e776c9715e6", "c3ee93d0ce548fdf839648fb8e24a3ed3448a429", "f562561dfe5bc0af22dfec6ecdb4438e2433150c", "cccf3733528a21dab2bf0286987041fa3f293b89", "e9411d26f9a9695330247df4d2be77990c920ed3", "0448157710be45fcd2c73304ab68dc3a1beb24b4", "e7ca82a955ae64bd43159099b39ae4053dbff3e7", "e83a530b3a45377225894925a2a68547ff972353", "e2ccb06f2928533c647828802730d3b434908f09", "0a37b00e6d84765e916b2d62dd87d3f1cac827c9", "be86fbb8a911d98a4a2c1478e86658eb76be216d", "e992288dcf9e54912dfa21e0c11c62c523c9835e", "130b1108d1c875258eedc51dc5e1b6974a2ee4ed", "93f220fc2ad068cbe6b5831117b21879bc40b391", "fecffbba1ab0744441ba6dcb2c11a194e073a42e", "f0d819c69dcd68a0ba941369a9f9499dd517a6aa", "ffc17ccab346334d0bdfc9b251112fbef97fc174", "3b51ff2fc04c9c7e0f88f9435e1ea85aa301d25d", "1ee064231419ba3b56f2c32157dc413bfcbd52a9", "ada18a5cc9a1ce3f3942fddeb95edeb1c7a908ef", "95d6ff6279fa0f92df6fae0e6bd4c259acfc8f09"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f8407c96157c4a17d9a5a8f144e01c2677674d6f", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2007/aaai07-024.php", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2007/AAAI07-024.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "161-166", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "7148585", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

The simulation results are given against those obtained by classical PID control without acceleration feedback loop, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach", "authors": [{"name": "Zhong-Shan  Wang", "ids": ["122244118"]}, {"name": "Ming  Zeng", "ids": ["143629822"]}, {"name": "Bao-Ku  Su", "ids": ["4716249"]}], "inCitations": ["963e1c8a4ff7cddf76d908984bfa75f40d02b592", "6c5cbd1e8738a4a85f7ae01c0a68a99d65be0cad"], "outCitations": ["a5b58cc722773133c0fe4a7d699777d1a510727c", "0f03d6b7ed253099130c381a23257c2d90cbb50a", "8bc1218bd86a7397818bd6599101baeea2704a28", "a2ac2b6ce4e4852e2e85a620ab91c8b04f05af48", "e13012e1cad89d407d323f88ca13d51b202d9eb5", "65e4088f3eb18a45e599f041f9bc1fbe87fb096d", "2f27a9a8480050c7b825eb59167ef9255c502150", "4738b863c8805e1f2ee508a9528e101de10674dd", "01fd88bfb151e663e10c2dcfbe2305d960cc46f6", "73bc477ff1e03a7256e0a08fb9fdb1ca9aabfc08", "721b493f89b5b6a9921e50be157d7f5344877cb5"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e929e6e5a5e66f0aaafb846f827a99fd62ad2086", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2006 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2006 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "972-977", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258526", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258526", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2149010248", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

In this case, it is unrealistic to ask agents to communicate a full ranking of all the alternatives. To address this, earlier work has proposed decomposing such voting processes by using local voting rules on the individual attributes. Unfortunately, the existing methods work only with rather severe domain restrictions, as they require the voters' preferences to extend acyclic CP-nets compatible with a common order on the attributes. We first show that this requirement is very restrictive, by proving that the number of linear orders extending an acyclic CP-net is exponentially smaller than the number of all linear orders. Then, we introduce a very general methodology that allows us to aggregate preferences when voters express CP-nets that can be cyclic. There does not need to be any common structure among the submitted CP-nets. Our methodology generalizes the earlier, more restrictive methodology. We study whether properties of the local rules transfer to the global rule, and vice versa. We also address how to compute the winning alternatives.", "authors": [{"name": "Lirong  Xia", "ids": ["35276487"]}, {"name": "Vincent  Conitzer", "ids": ["1749906"]}, {"name": "J\u00e9r\u00f4me  Lang", "ids": ["145417235"]}], "inCitations": ["b264af9e98f9772e8cd3d032a53fe570a3a6aa05", "833a85ea7d55279ae54895cbd1e6fa4c1a91b805", "642de12d0f0a3d43a11a0198fa1b0dc4b7e3e9c6", "25d4589839e4c0ec868fad5c2e3e788d755bb2e3", "e3bca37ca85b813f836b0fc9d44dc21acdd808d8", "536145435bf6841dd689e7c28e7d1954b0fe1ec5", "f315f8b31f4006654fe7fca4aaaf11bc9cdc52b3", "89f7db77a755d44d3aabdbcc7549b743d7debcc5", "e4b575c93d9f2fe6f3f4b9d59199662bac4a1f54", "dc2225a90d458a179645000f6159a6a8e6654c0b", "2641b3cbc295c227b0ce880229fb867495bedb42", "b8ea2dfaa052085b96ce41ef751014662e04dbb6", "fb9730e3a92d7529d04e0451de695981ce899e74", "c21bfdb17caba78cc252c10b1c2328de380a61df", "29ce866004a4cf222798afaf2d62034d42ce7d8f", "38cfaa305810a6cfc3bb6281647dba7a5a8cdb2b", "21a45849a5862117ae363d8fc118951771461d42", "524209a45e65ca6ca6a7ad8c433eee16cbf0a0e2", "1a52bfd054b4b93dd41ab33b21c8805c16099ec3", "ae0f2c5fac120db3e070354b6f70ad160cabda6c", "84370f2fa3ac21ed3c6a30144fbdb377157b8853", "6f16a5f508c1d391d21867a8218a1f2ab03e422c", "21b356086dba9464e40c2b8b6aa333e3cffa7283", "7eaac61811d934b49561402c29b0ded0648bce44", "a2e3a08fae7633e433700055e81768549f684742", "45c445c077289ed12f5330f757431bf0d4501d14", "f752bf6f8c1502b8cb58aa1483ef598f9fc0d44c", "bd0f425872f6bffbdb26c2f5e620b9a65c60b4cd", "fc34a5f317b4345c9c38f46c91a930c467b8d6f8", "6438e6d7a8f4fb135cc4f4aefe76ed4429e98eb4", "55c0899f430d5618e391fa51502e25095242162f", "1a9c89cb2e57e06dadd4c2fab5fae1bfdbb3b6d5", "9fff486de22421b0f06ff5834fc7b03739cdd801", "912084abe9b54dc03ceddff6fe265f049c0687a7", "b2b3ded7679cb8f33277f7a8b8a6b040b5334f14", "bc95b8e0537a5321781b9ec866bd9684178b99a9", "b08d48c3c49ea6a67b3122b0c7f072d1cf3e5965", "f7f0dc525050fb64dc892d8c4ff7fa85684d6428", "10c6205d92bfafa24e3d835328aee66247c371a9", "a5cac785c35c0af3be9792359322867ba3e85a7a", "f46a19784a26f9835de5305dadcfe933745d629d", "ca4f0a7e0ce3d318aff6f21a3896de16e2539250", "166341ed50e1f0b46ce7533d9c29f04c8bdf5bd3", "6db67fce16ae4f90a3c74783a538906147f2292a", "285986ed24a636c0f00b8b7721e2b95e30b3a742", "7c04660779ef4b0063419bf64b230214b194d673", "d4f2b41accbf7d62491b3d7364c38aaeab9dcd06", "d20731acf7f916ba29ddab328db26bb7047893ed", "3f38387de397d3c03a5cda881c0b38d35ba9bc0e", "8df4ad244e9069b51fe6ff1a9ce1561d901148a1", "365d528933477db8f45536992729abfabeb0d10c", "dacb51fface30452558dc885a799ea108f44aabc", "8fe2aaaef0fbd9f15e243e147c103648188a6265", "0fbc096130dd0d20625d143d6869363f8aaa5c74", "97611a1d6d7b750b28a88d3d18dec044af5244a8", "8d2aab5f6eca51a883c6b345fa38f7567d6409e0", "79b6c868863d7fbb417da154695b10550822cd9e"], "outCitations": ["0ec13c38c16de93852efa422a64fc772d7cf2f48", "d29f2cc6367eb4a76d6020d4e0252b301407f709", "fb0a81cb45b85160b0112c109f6eff4d01a02cb4", "675387ddcafc219ef34b6822deb40e73a08617a0", "49431033f2aa79abd8a980bcf3a9a851acd30728", "c623d1d4b4d94741d4df3885c409876152643b65", "47999efec7b533f18abeb0b43573dac5a4395e69", "951ad4fd292a167f68dc81406a083dfb3e39399e", "f78f54ea4ff4e67e0d980e89d8d9badb1de283f5", "1a2eb0998ac119f44c37246b34eaa517cd403200", "075d244f44750a1c1de6d363713d05fea3e32192", "69cabebe97e1f56194b81052a3229bddf85393ef", "349d84b45973c5b5fdaf5b0b567bb128a0e131cc", "2d69ebde3488667930fa700f49f270e2b298ebe5", "07ac7a3f84808bee93794bee30b485e533b85fe6", "bdec405c7e04f39ebeb794a01f53eb9227054632", "dcb79eb53ca71bd6c43650f362f263277308fd43", "7a69e7b7b9f796c4387279c60a0d683a4e2469ac", "412dada7685b5a71c763b6cd5a641e286d8586ff"], "year": 2008, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c84e2a924a16f556068adfab931478d8e2f4168a", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~xial/Files/AAAI08_voting_cyclic_dependencies.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2008/aaai08-032.php", "http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~lxia/Files/AAAI08_voting_cyclic_dependencies.pdf", "https://users.cs.duke.edu/~conitzer/cyclic_votingAAAI08.pdf", "https://www.cs.duke.edu/~conitzer/cyclic_votingAAAI08.pdf", "http://cs.duke.edu/~conitzer/cyclic_votingAAAI08.pdf", "http://cs.rpi.edu//~xial/Files/AAAI08_voting_cyclic_dependencies.pdf", "http://www.cs.duke.edu/~conitzer/cyclic_votingAAAI08.pdf", "http://www.cs.duke.edu/~lxia/Files/AAAI08_voting_cyclic_dependencies.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2008/AAAI08-032.pdf", "http://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~lang/papers/xcl08.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "202-207", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "118605032", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Our objective is to allow users to interactively understand the blogspace by providing a system framework for retrieving relevant weblogs and obtaining highlighted information. We focus on two important technical components in the system. The first is weblog ranking. We introduce weighted link-based weblog ranking, which ranks the popularity of weblogs according to their entry semantic content and time delay of citation. Furthermore, our weblog ranking algorithms provide the flexibility to rank weblogs not only based on their different roles in the society, but also based on end-users\u2019 different ranking interests. The second component is hot story summarization. A hot story is the discussion that attracts various weblogs\u2019 attention. Influential bloggers are useful in identifying hot conversations because these bloggers are likely to be the leader in such conversations. We propose a method based on first discovering weblogs that take important roles in the society, and then extracting hot story from these important weblogs.", "authors": [{"name": "Yi  Wu", "ids": ["40398991"]}, {"name": "Belle L.

{"id": "fe48577f513f0ea4304d042fadbac6d6664641b4", "title": "Integrated Introspective Case-Based Reasoning for Intelligent Tutoring Systems", "text": "Many intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) have been developed, deployed, assessed, and proven to facilitate learning. However, most of these systems do not generally adapt to new circumstances, do not self-evaluate and self-configure their own strategies, and do not monitor the usage history of the learning content being delivered or presented to the students. These shortcomings force ITS developers to often spend much development time in manual revision and fine-tuning of the learning and instructional contents of an ITS. In this paper, we describe an intelligent agent that delivers learning material adaptively to different students, factoring in the usage history of the learning materials and student profiles as observed by the agent. Student-tutor interaction includes the activities of going through learning material, such as a topical tutorial, a set of examples, and a set of problems. Our assumption is that our agent will be able to capture and utilize these student activities as the primer to select the appropriate examples or problems to administer to the student. Using an integrated introspective case-based reasoning approach, our agent further learns from its experience and refines its reasoning process-including the instructional strategies-to adapt to student needs. Moreover, our agent monitors the usage history of the learning materials to improve its performance. We have built an end-to-end ITS using an agent powered by this integrated introspective case-based reasoning engine. We have deployed the ITS in a CS course. Results indicate that the ITS was able to learn to deliver more appropriate examples and problems to the students.", "authors": [{"name": "Leen-Kiat  Soh", "ids": ["144578385"]}], "inCitations": ["a10eb9ab422836c4f0786ef31ebc852c590d8cf1", "e14292744a15b99de6f7d94d2279df961f0fca4e", "fe0387455eaafa81814f4aef124ca9b22438cd83"], "outCitations": ["30af78eb6827672311cbcfdb7f7624b645c4f9c6", "6045fcc3f3a6f505408433e7e8191e63ece74b7f", "4a761eac38f044143217889673672130e7911d13", "c54d2d31ae608aed27fc5ce99e82703e06abf36e", "fb81a7d0a7cb0027f1b8ac5d9f019545861991f0", "a7cf7c441d6dcf69f0e2af73e73b43a052e4f32d", "c7ab9e9507cc66fd9a6c39c46db30563d8375450", "195fdc9fbdc1ede91ad976bb094980f23f032118", "800b53592a62718ae30026858215755b558baab5", "04b10f970c1c81205ea35e521f452d1ca7da0756", "8e1c208853d06e0ff812c42828305ff67cd746dc", "54f146be9792bd85a65089c15c891d9a54f21f67", "7e5f71972e3c50777bfba3ddbe8813be8d89277c", "e0c6276d4c42c2567d490f08e391374160a335af", "cafacc1c19c5ccd9db6d9158ac4fbc4ed0b817bd", "cda97f8f04b67af28d79c0c1b1d752ce3e97fe0d", "e16053aa00f802cd1142c0a2dc7b0a440c9a3f72", "23dfccd19093718db5b3da2981b772a17ca77758", "895ec0d51ee532a216024384ff374f6275ff749a", "1c4081269d539ec83390e649142acd50a35318b4", "bdafe02794ea743d794e2c4c954f4ede9636872d"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fe48577f513f0ea4304d042fadbac6d6664641b4", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2007/aaai07-248.php", "http://cse.unl.edu/~lksoh/pubs/conference/Soh_AAAI2007.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2007/AAAI07-248.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1566-1571", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "137596542", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Our solution to this difficult issue is to use a cognitive architecture, which contains well-validated mechanisms for many aspects of human cognition, including cognitive control.

We argue that our approach of conceptual spatial mapping helps bridge the gap between the representations needed for low-level control of the robot, and the conceptualtopological representations of space humans have. Our approach maintains spatial knowledge on multiple interconnected layers. We show that a process for map acquisition, human-augmented mapping, which combines bottom-up and top-down influences from different modalities, will yield a rich multi-layered spatial representation. This representation enables the robot to perform complex actions in a human-populated environment.

Computer systems use explanations to justify their conclusions. User acceptance of a system depends partly on how well the system explains its reasoning and justifies its conclusions. We have built WOZ, an explanation framework that justifies the conclusions of a clinical decision-support system. WOZ\u2019s central component is the explanation strategy that decides what information justifies a claim. The strategy uses Toulmin\u2019s argument structure to define pieces of explanatory information and to orchestrate their presentation. WOZ uses explicit models that abstract the core aspects of the framework such as the explanation strategy. In this paper, we present the use of arguments, the modeling of explanations, and the explanation process used in WOZ. WOZ exploits the wealth of naturally occurring arguments, and thus can generate convincing medical explanations. The Proposal \u2013 Explanations as Arguments Clinical practice guidelines encapsulate bodies of medical evidence and other knowledge necessary for decisionmaking about specific health problems. In the past few years, we have seen considerable interest in decisionsupport systems that automate clinical practice guidelines. Such systems can be used by clinicians to provide patient care that is informed by the guidelines. These systems especially help inexperienced or non-specialist clinicians to follow advanced evidence-based best practices relevant to their patients. In our laboratory at Stanford Medical Informatics we have developed the EON architecture \u2013 a set of software components with which developers can build robust guideline-based decision-support systems [Musen et al. 1996]. Based on EON, we have built ATHENA DSS, a decision-support system for managing primary hypertension at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System [Goldstein et al. 2000]. ATHENA DSS interprets the hypertension guideline model using specific patient data, and provides patient-specific recommendations for clinical management (Figure 1). For example, as shown in Figure 1, ATHENA DSS can recommend adding a specific drug to the patient\u2019s regimen because the patient Figure 1. ATHENA DSS recommendations screen.

Continuous learning and online decisionmaking in complex dynamic environments under conditions of uncertainty and limited computational recourses represent one of the most challenging problems for developing robust intelligent systems. The existing task of unsupervised clustering in statistical learning requires the maximizing (or minimizing) of a certain similarity-based objective function defining an optimal segmentation of the input data set into clusters, which is an NP-hard optimization problem for general metric spaces and is computationally intractable for real-world problems of practical interest (Davidson and Ravi 2005). The task of continuous online learning in complex dynamic environments assumes near real-time mining of streaming data continually arriving at the system, which imposes additional requirements for continuous clustering algorithms. This paper describes the developed computationally efficient adaptive multi-agent approach to continuous online clustering of streaming data in complex uncertain environments and a knowledge-based self-organizing multi-agent system for implementing it. A multi-agent approach to adaptive continuous learning. We address the problem of continuous online learning in changing environments by developing a hybrid learning approach to be both intelligible and computationally efficient that combines multiagent distributed resource allocation and model-based reinforcement learning of POMDPs. The developed multi-agent approach to adaptive online unsupervised learning of streaming data is based on an asynchronous message-passing method of continuous agglomerative hierarchical clustering and a knowledge-based competitive multi-agent system for implementing it. The proposed computationally efficient multi-agent algorithm for online agglomerative hierarchical clustering of streaming data is different from conventional unsupervised learning methods by being distributed, dynamic, and continuous. Distributed clustering process provides the ability to perform efficient run-time learning from both centralized and decentralized data sources without an additional centralized algorithm of aggregating partial mining results. Both the input dataset of decentralized sources and decision criteria for learning (e.g. similarity matrices and expert knowledge) are not fixed and can be changed at runtime during execution of the dynamic algorithm.

Clustering results of the adaptive learning algorithm are available at any time and continuously improved to achieve a global solution to the constrained optimization problem of clustering, trading off operating time and result quality. As opposed to previous work, we propose a different multi-agent approach to continuous online learning by modeling the task of unsupervised clustering as a dynamic distributed resource allocation problem and implementing the concept of clustering by asynchronous messagepassing (Frey and Dueck 2007) whereby an implicit global quasi-optimal solution to the constrained optimization problem of clustering is obtained by satisfying a dynamic distributed constraint network defined for data elements. The data-driven self-organizing process of dynamic continuous optimization is based on the constant distributed search to maintain a dynamic balance among the interests", "authors": [{"name": "Igor  Kiselev", "ids": ["145404738"]}, {"name": "Reda  Alhajj", "ids": ["144451975"]}], "inCitations": ["86ced9f6c565236c73aa586d1f0b9d0066dcac89", "5ed9798d9abc3934b2b0b50ee6d50798982b0fb7", "6f27a2dc56e8adcb35c59546c54c9f1cf16190c7", "bbba7896ed8067f44832745e53fec1cc9102f8a9", "c676ea3d4210bee9eadb9f8d96f7f7d5497b5500", "bfc4ceb4d67c44912a530164cc8d16eabe1b11da", "4e953d16e20122d76cbac955d929d4e771885f65", "0c98f00dd10a4803bfc86aab46abebca15d4700c", "20b8a5874ca4c01633f6ca4241fcb7f845271159", "46a98f888c7cfc2ec9d46e88896c587976fdc1d4", "7d31cb4e454b6cbb2f0ee1bf65ac54f0b1fa388c", "df6cda9240b84d66cc34de48413ee81d7f05904d"], "outCitations": ["1fcd8971378cfbfe9d52889493af5c05b9a345e5", "ca839260a9e13f21fff53b7227d6d363cf3d4735", "7c354b78e99246f32bc839c627b7f3adab1b06d3"], "year": 2008, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7bd5735a1a2304313a2fdc181b1fc43f62686733", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2008/AAAI08-294.pdf", "http://aaaipress.org/Papers/AAAI/2008/AAAI08-294.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2008/aaai08-294.php"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1808-1809", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "252007472", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

The main purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the techniques for automatically annotating HRI trial videos with participant supplied comfort data. During the trial participants indicated via a Comfort Level Device (CLD) their preferences for robot approach distances. This data was correlated with distance measurements obtained from the CLD annotated video recording of the trials. The development of a postprocessing technique for overlaying a structured grid on to the video recordings of the trial, allowed a continuous record of both human and robot\u2019s positions and distances during the HRI trials to be recorded.

In the face of open systems and environmental change, pre-defined ontologies are suboptimal. In open systems, new agents or web services can require new conventions not captured in existing conceptualizations. A more adaptive and more theoretically interesting approach is to have agents negotiate repertoires of categories, meanings, and linguistic forms among themselves. Many related issues arise in the general arena of \u201cemergent semantics\u201d; the case of language serves as an excellent \u201cmodel organism\u201d for studying the issues, and results generalize nicely to other domains including \u201ccollaborative tagging\u201d and bioinformatics. One central problem in emergent, adaptive language is getting a population of agents to converge on shared meanings and forms\u2014this is called the \u201cLanguage Convergence\u201d problem. The problem can be framed as follows. Suppose we have a population of N agents, each of which is using their own language. The population arrives at a converged state when all the agents are speaking the same language. When this state is achieved, the agents can communicate with each other. There are many different ideas on what a language is, but for our purposes we will use a simple definition. We assume that the lexicon (the set of possible words) is fixed, and that a language is a mapping from meanings (objects in the world to words). This is a common abstraction of language. When the mapping is represented as a matrix, it is often called an association matrix", "authors": [{"name": "Kiran  Lakkaraju", "ids": ["1808382"]}, {"name": "Les  Gasser", "ids": ["1794830"]}], "inCitations": ["5b2f04934d7bb8baf5740a0d3a82be7fd00033b8"], "outCitations": ["07d88404f24d61a8ea41ee7f688f57ee8f44ac12", "1c19f1d33b28242a7e8ca34b2e7a188388c91951", "5dd19cc9406463358c6cf2c1d2a4e362e2e23aa8", "81f76934c27a6cf8e63cc7b0a2e261fd5a2a7daa", "94ed6d481c696eb2b2d9a0b6927618409a981231", "d61031326150ba23f90e6587c13d99188209250e", "eb18a5d9d6d130f399220b7b5eb1a8ea9a73e908"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dba1e5e1d3f2de8d7181572e96cd0f6774fe731d", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2006/AAAI06-322.pdf", "https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2006/AAAI06-322.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2006/aaai06-322.php"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1887-1888", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1513568697", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

{"id": "a8eb33f27276f9e945848d984e97b91a38d93caf", "title": "In Support of Pragmatic Computation", "text": "This paper argues that human cognition is structured to support solving in unmanageably large problem spaces. Machines face similar challenges, and can therefore benefit from the same kinds of approaches. Pragmatic human cognitive mechanisms already appear in AI artifacts, and more should be considered. Examples are drawn from human and programmed approaches to game playing, constraint satisfaction, and protein sequence alignment. People and artificially intelligent machines both solve problems. From a machine\u2019s perspective, however, the ability of people to function not only adequately but expertly is nothing short of miraculous. Human memories are clearly limited and often inaccurate, human algorithms are mysterious, and human heuristics are na\u00efve. Although endowed with good sensory mechanisms, people often choose to ignore relevant data. Although they invented logic, they rarely represent their reasoning that way. The issue is whether an artificial intelligence should capitalize on what is known about human reasoning. It is the thesis of this paper that cognitive science has been, and must continue to be, relevant to the way AI programs solve problems. This is not because people are an exemplar of cognition, but because human cognitive mechanisms were developed to cope with problems that are beyond our computational capacity. People do pragmatic computation, that is, they arrive at and explain adequate decisions efficiently. Here, an adequate decision is one that supports the multiple goals of the decision maker, and efficiency is measured by the consumption of cognitive resources. Efficient explanation entails a concise description of the process, possibly for the benefit of other agents. When people ignore information or modify a procedure in a way that compromises its correctness because they can do so with impunity, they are computing pragmatically. When an artificial intelligence is pressed beyond its capacity, it should compute pragmatically too. Real-world decisions are always subject to a myriad of potential but unlikely catastrophes that lurk in a dynamic environment. Factoring each of them into a decision (e.g., crossing the street) would consume additional computing resources, but likely produce the same decision. Because, in the real world there are always additional goals to address, an intelligence, real or artificial, would do better to compute pragmatically and move on to the next problem. This paper describes some pragmatic human cognitive mechanisms, and shows how many programs (even \u201cbrute force\u201d ones) already incorporate them. After some basic definitions, it explores how people and programs use knowledge, representation, and meta-heuristics in problem solving. It considers the role of visual cognition and selfawareness, and poses some challenging issues for research. Throughout, examples are drawn from game playing, constraint satisfaction, and protein sequence alignment. A constraint satisfaction problem <X,D,C> is a set of variables X, a set of domains D for those variables, and a set of constraints C, restrictions on the way values from the domains may be assigned to the variables. Constraint solving seeks an assignment of a value to each variable from its domain so that all the constraints are satisfied. Graph coloring and scheduling are both constraint satisfaction problems. Protein sequence alignment seeks to arrange complex physical objects in a way that emphasizes their threedimensional and/or evolutionary similarities. Given a string on a 20-letter alphabet (the residues), there is usually a single way the protein it represents will arrange itself in space. A good alignment of two such strings, for example, S K \u2014 T T W T T K S S T W S pairs identical, biophysically or evolutionarily similar residues with each other. Each gap insertion (here the symbol \u2014) incurs a penalty, part of which is proportional to its length. Programs for constraint satisfaction and protein sequence alignment are powerful but still inadequate for many tasks; both problems are NP-complete. Problem Solving and Search First, some basic definitions. A world state is a set of data that describes some limited perspective at a moment in time, such as pieces on a chess board or assignments of values to constrained variables. An operator is a function that transforms one world state into another. A goal test is a boolean function on world states, and a goal state is one that passes the goal test. A problem consists of a set of world states (the problem\u2019s state space), a set of operators defined on them, and a goal test. Problem solving is the search for some world state that passes the goal test. The global search paradigm searches state space from a designated world state (the initial state), applying one operator at a time until some world state passes the goal test. A solution to a problem is either a goal state (e.g., constraint satisfaction or protein sequence alignment) or the search path to it (e.g., chess). In a state space of challenging size, intelligence requires more than fast global search \u2014 it also requires knowledge. For example, a machine cannot play chess by exhaustive lookahead because the chess state space is unmanageably large. Although Deep Blue played chess on specialpurpose hardware that examined millions of states per second, it still lost its first match against Gary Kasparov in 1996. As computers\u2019 speed and memory increase, the goals set for AI programs become more ambitious. Thus there will always be problems (e.g., Go, scheduling, protein sequence alignment) on which uninformed search is inadequate. The Role of Knowledge Expert knowledge focuses, directs, and resolves search. At the beginning of search, a problem solver\u2019s initial decisions (its opening) prune away large portions of the space. An opening is a knowledge-based heuristic; its function is to make the state space more manageable without dramatically reducing the likelihood that a solution can be found. In constraint solving, for example, openings are crucial; there is recent evidence that one need only get the first few variables\u2019 values correct to solve certain kinds of very large problems (Gomes, Selman et al. 2000). A game opening is simply a sequence of moves known to lead to successful play in the hands of an expert. Although carefully chronicled and studies, game openings are heuristics that may be revised or even discredited. Even in large state spaces, it may be possible to search exhaustively for a path to a goal state beginning from what we call solvable states. Solvable states arise relatively deep in search, and may not form part of the eventual solution. As protein alignment decisions are made, for example, short sequences arise that must be aligned; as values are assigned in constraint solving, small subproblems arise. Both can be solved by exhaustive search. Unlike openings, knowledge about solvable states is guaranteed correct because it is based on goal tests for all the states in some portion of the space. If solvable states recur, either in the domain (as they do in chess) or repeatedly in a single problem (as they do in constraint solving), storing their results can speed search. Traditionally, solvable state libraries for games (endgame knowledge) have been developed by hand and shared among human experts. Although a human expert can get a reasonable head start from an opening, and search flawlessly from solvable states, in between she must still make search decisions. A heuristic evaluation function estimates the likelihood that search progressing through a state will lead to a solution. An evaluation function is based on features (state descriptions) that predict that likelihood. Chess players think about pawn structure and control of the center, biophysicists about hydrophobicity and beta-sheets, and constraint solvers about promise and fail-firstness. A human expert may use tens (or even hundreds) of such features. Many AI artifacts use knowledge the way people do. One can engineer a problem solver for a particular domain by providing a search engine with openings, a solvable state library, and a good evaluation function. Openings are provided by programmers. Computers have verified knowledge about solvable states and, with their accuracy and speed, extended it (Hsu 2002; Schaeffer, Bjornsson et al. 2003). A programmer usually provides an AI artifact with the features for its evaluation function, although the program is generally called upon to find a method to combine them. When Deep Blue won its rematch against Kasparov in 1997, the most significant improvement in the program had been an infusion of grandmaster-level knowledge. At the time, there was much discussion about the fact that the program was not playing the way people do: it did not plan or learn, it just did fast, deep search. What the press overlooked, however, was that Deep Blue had inherited from its human creators the same knowledge-based coping mechanisms people use when confronted with a problem of unmanageable size. The winning version of Deep Blue included an enlarged database of openings curated by three grandmasters plus an extensive, computer-generated endgame database. Most importantly, the winning version had an elaborate evaluation function carefully tuned under the supervision of a fourth grandmaster. Other game-playing champions continue in this tradition. Chinook\u2019s creators persist in their drive to solve checkers, through a combination of intensive state-space exploration and the management of an enormous endgame database (Schaeffer, Bjornsson et al. 2005). TD-gammon the backgammon player (Tesauro 1994) emphasized learning to combine the features in its evaluation function. Logistello, the Othello program that defeated the human world champion in 1997, uses on a combination of patternbased, learned features for its evaluation function (Buro 1999). All of these programs rely on extensive opening databases and have had c", "authors": [{"name": "Susan L.

Near-Term Analysis uses Dynamic Network Analysis metrics (in ORA) for estimating changes in a Multi-Agent Simulation model of social and knowledge network evolution (called Dynet). Specifically, Near-Term Analysis simulates the social dynamics within an organization based on an organization's meta-matrix and expected isolation events of agents, and it generates its estimation about the degree of knowledge diffusion from the simulation over the simulated time period. From this analysis, we found this tool is useful in detecting inefficient entities in organization structures and expecting the impacts of the loss of agents. Furthermore, the simulation result correlated with the social network analysis measures qualitatively.

After demonstrating our algorithm on some examples, we explore its use in applications to fluid flow and microarray data", "authors": [{"name": "Shawn  Martin", "ids": ["144002883"]}], "inCitations": ["d84e3254e3c4f4c17484643b8c3abdf5b0dbb761", "9985d367755e96466405ce97d84677c1a1775ac8", "b7abd515a881ba53732bf7e319fe137315b919b4", "fe11341be2d4d138e6a2532be4b90c6ea8e862a3", "a7898dbd73ef96e008d8e9c560b1802c2df4aca6", "2656fa943865dff53a391b29ef858f00a6df648b", "c4c167a3caa95730292594c3d519acb652ef81b6"], "outCitations": ["2f1a9350fd8141bcda3068aec33aef385d5c02eb", "1ad15c08556c8f8e3739703857ea01077ce738c5", "58fcdef15bd41f3231ef0f3ca8cf8138116f5f79", "edebb2d061660173ffe7e69f4bf94329134e5cc5", "2e73081ed096c62c073b3faa1b3b80aab89998c5", "afcd6da7637ddeef6715109aca248da7a24b1c65", "2599131a4bc2fa957338732a37c744cfe3e17b24", "3537fcd0ff99a3b3cb3d279012df826358420556", "3e43d731d638f769f12f8ab413d14a77a761856c", "7b6b146566b4c55ec0af9589456f4745c8ce3e38", "6600ccefb3da850eab31e1242d99b3840e86930c", "cce218b91cf634413ef9a71f702bd37b1a9ad2a6", "356125478f5d06b564b420755a4944254045bbbe", "e65c869dc481c1aaa3293625ae35ace6f98e3916", "c2ebc4e4c5b421ab7b70ab6076f78c3220c54bfe", "551bb4142794dd682acf9a1159063158895e8214", "d5051890e501117097eeffbd8ded87694f0d8063", "a2a73cf85a0b9e39a52301aa10004e5beb670039"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4727fd282ce6e500a007c798592c0365b277bd3c", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.sandia.gov/~smartin/posters/Martin_ApproxKPCA_Poster.pdf", "http://www.sandia.gov/~smartin/presentations/Martin_ApproxKPCA_Presentation.pdf", "http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2006.13", "http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/homepages/smartin/presentations/Martin_ApproxKPCA_Presentation.pdf", "https://www.sandia.gov/smartin/_assets/documents/posters/Martin_ApproxKPCA_Poster.pdf"], "venue": "2006 5th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA'06)", "journalName": "2006 5th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA'06)", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "239-244", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2006.13", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2006.13", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2155491393", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Such algorithms guarantee soundness and completeness, but are \u03a32P-hard. To overcome this complexity problem, which prohibits the computation of high-cardinality diagnoses for large systems, we propose a novel approximation approach for multiple-fault diagnosis, based on a greedy stochastic algorithm called SAFARI (StochAstic Fault diagnosis Algo-RIthm). We prove that SAFARI can be configured to compute diagnoses which are of guaranteed minimality under subsumption. We analytically model SAFARI search as a Markov chain, and show a probabilistic bound on the minimality of its minimal diagnosis approximations. We have applied this algorithm to the 74XXX and ISCAS85 suites of benchmark combinatorial circuits, demonstrating order-of-magnitude speedups over two state-of-the-art deterministic algorithms, CDA* and HA*, for multiple-fault diagnoses.", "authors": [{"name": "Alexander  Feldman", "ids": ["46904802"]}, {"name": "Gregory M.

Here I describe my thesis work modeling the learning and use of spatial prepositions and applying this model to the task of knowledge capture.", "authors": [{"name": "Kate  Lockwood", "ids": ["6566322"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["b80bc483e4402bad1dae864a6225ffb89b536af8", "ef4fcd435e5431899b9df599f7cde45e7291e730", "934a15c1bfc34a2993da59eea486e6e6225c6027", "613aae5f60f8f01809811df80175928c44ea321d", "6fefdd5353400ef0178cc06470dc199601102e55", "16d4fba7acc0363c851ad4db5082942a74902732", "5708dcfa4e2f0280c0fd01830f9e2ec824654d54", "b4aeb665438d03a8aab2c255afe7194fb60d4a19", "f5e122f0b6c07ca1d033ce19c45ea86396f67018", "3a4b3ae38aefa4eb5a2972a9a42f53f27a90eeba", "0a3ae920157d0a2ca4dd91ba2b8799f8e33de1c5", "f557900b3a47f51941976231d1fb577481c4c33e", "4d2993a1b01f8744cd03882e00ac41705b7d97d3", "0f1dd7e297bbbc28469fb19f4135f0a1beac3fbd"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/00834f2e8d58edd838d08cf73dfd9db7d18c7b2e", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2007/AAAI07-343.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2007/aaai07-343.php", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2007/AAAI07-343.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1937-1938", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "75218127", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

It uses a novel point primitive that is called \"Spherical Patch Point\" (SPP) to approximate the vicinity of a surface point. Due to property of curvature, SPP can achieve similar visual quality compared with previous methods with much fewer primitives for the cost of a few additional bytes per point and thus makes a significant reduction in rendering time. During pre-process, important attributes are added to each SPP for the purpose of ray tracing. During rendering, an intersection algorithm different from previous ones has been demonstrated to get satisfied results. The proposed technique makes it possible to render high quality ray traced images with global illumination using SPPs. It offers a higher ray tracing speed in comparison with previous methods", "authors": [{"name": "Yong  Quan", "ids": ["143760220"]}, {"name": "Wen-Hui  Li", "ids": ["2891321"]}, {"name": "Yun-Jie  Pang", "ids": ["121007341"]}, {"name": "Bin  Zhou", "ids": ["46307972"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["116330dd43db80853ffde828100854d89b8916aa", "14ae5dc33da822d0e7e14bf50e690be885b9a908", "c3eb42dccf5f00e84c7087ed0e31f62bbc5b63f1", "5f1bda75d28803efb5c1a38770cfa96002287aec", "44bf97f5c45c84380dcf4da217c84c9847511ec1", "879fd72ceff3c944c2ded199a5a477851ffce9a2", "a66c0b42f1460639ca43d244db19318695fa07d0"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d83be7ec37f308ac80ae86101b05c8430596bc9f", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2006 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2006 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "3982-3986", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258795", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258795", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2138926936", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

A description of our algorithm along with a performance evaluation of COACH on real data is provided. COACH is an innovative algorithm designed for building an online handwriting evaluation tool to be used for classifying and remediating handwriting deficiencies. COACH adapts learning and data mining techniques from AI to handwriting deficiency classification in an innovative fashion. Until now handwriting classification has been performed manually by trained therapists causing expensive and subjective evaluation. This application lowers the cost of evaluation, increases objectiveness, and enables repeated testing that can accompany therapy. COACH is evaluated on real data obtained from children with poor handwriting using a digitizer tablet. Results show that COACH manages to successfully differentiate between poor to proficient handwriting. Differentiation is obtained even after using data from only a few words. These results prove that COACH is a promising emerging application for online evaluation.", "authors": [{"name": "Ariella  Richardson", "ids": ["2817130"]}, {"name": "Sarit  Kraus", "ids": ["144992450"]}, {"name": "Patrice L.

In this paper, we develop a novel strategy, namely knowledge-driven multi-level independent component analysis (ICA), to infer regulatory signals and identify biologically relevant biomarkers from microarray data. Specifically, based on multi-level clustering results and partial prior knowledge, we apply ICA to find stable disease specific linear regulatory modes and then extract associated biomarker genes. A statistical test is designed to evaluate the significance of transcription factor enrichment for extracted gene set based on motif information. The experimental results on an Rsf-1 induced microarray data set show that our knowledge-driven method can extract more biologically meaningful biomarkers with significant enrichment of transcription factors related to ovarian cancer compared to other gene selection methods with/without prior knowledge.", "authors": [{"name": "Li  Chen", "ids": ["144423429"]}, {"name": "Chen  Wang", "ids": ["40614774"]}, {"name": "Ie-Ming  Shih", "ids": ["144376583"]}, {"name": "Tian-Li  Wang", "ids": ["3287681"]}, {"name": "Zhen  Zhang", "ids": ["145013534"]}, {"name": "Yue Joseph Wang", "ids": ["31138057"]}, {"name": "Robert  Clarke", "ids": ["1716659"]}, {"name": "Eric P.

In general, the valuations of variables appearing in various functions provided by the service are not known before execution. Consequently, to analyze the behavior of a service, all possible valuations need to be considered, making the whole system infinite-state. Against this background, we propose a framework for modeling and composing Web services where desired (goal) and pre-existing (component) services exhibit infinite-state behavior. Our approach finitely represents such services using Symbolic Transition Systems (STSs) which are transition systems augmented with guards over infinitedomain variables. We develop a sound and complete logical approach for identifying the existence of composition of available component-STSs, such that the resulting composition is \u201csimulated\u201d by the goal-STS. In the event that the goal service cannot be realized from the existing components, our technique can also identify the cause for the failure and guide the user to achieve appropriate refinement of the goal specification, thereby paving the way for incremental development of composite services.", "authors": [{"name": "Jyotishman  Pathak", "ids": ["145236681"]}, {"name": "Samik  Basu", "ids": ["145561383"]}, {"name": "Vasant  Honavar", "ids": ["145513516"]}], "inCitations": ["b5f36f07237472740971b7033d70fbddc5aefde6", "6de6469209d8ee6df73856675d1bc84d3675ca6b", "ad2dd8337a56731de4d752ae56af22c9d60fc09b", "89e286781954b237106f31ed2b861ebdfe08b692", "4c5cdb39c822af6469fccdda751d4046b3f1ef19", "7998c146a2c0cac41b1d62b0596ff3890c0bd039", "c60a56ebd0651b302d7f5a908e509b1ee8aae4ce", "9d270d7d19d88e669dea1eaaffa8df4afa467780", "6b8c17906c60cd0e8f280381abc49ca489fa8477", "283d5695fffcc6781255ac4e9e177586a848063a", "9a9005f807e899bea6457e245333f8274bbd3e37", "2098a5e5a4670ba41cd1b1f1dba77b0c81efb582", "bf3d5ac0b65c830467d97fb8f660a029880b2a3c", "ca52d27d70a119ca016307ae534fd27d2883be7f", "b8f7687ee86050e3baa07292f833bf7cae22db27", "016032f2e63326c2136620c695730db9ec936cc2", "a610611cb20f53ca0ac69682c354437fce03e041", "e56bfa063693a8134107b329335fadb339701f5e", "0eca9b85af8e1de7c1bea47014aa861b27362258", "873e7447d2ecc42d475f9b6bbc8e0e69e08d1e6c", "5068cae5464496595aecc67a6070da0d69ff694a", "0dd069b397f566b0c7fb9a294d0ee956ff5cceaa", "0b37c519bc9ef7b1a338f31aa6d714277935ac9c", "d3e8a4e50148ea1bfdd6c35189f098b0edf588d5", "ea1cfcd205118debb1efb53e118ea421518b1026", "18cf2303ace366b4f0b4ba20d05cd1c7f07e5cba", "59b861ea0357902b5502d2f99b5873663765b629"], "outCitations": ["69356e4db9a485340ce2f4c874ddd2bb2b673392", "64a1ce239cba646fdc9040b1314a59fc63092f62", "9dfee513952d1d0d39df6a46b04e0fd7d42f9c4e", "72e0802c917104b36a396135bcb5876494abe00e", "9765234e7f89f7724848be60e5e203c9332c06a3", "38aec9dc8577a8b55b2c2d42f049725f1d4a2762", "3edf2cf8736c3b0c32adae354b9f159467cddef5", "d14aa2c99ac4a8f5260215c408cc402e713296bc", "48a2f01318287910a76a258a72a870f0eec7dc01", "5aaac0d38df421261d97ff0aed603f40e60d4707", "d501c13c3c5c930ecd63baad39dbd5f56f7eeb9b", "c9253ce46a869d921a304c30ca604820089c8d9d", "1cc1765a7512f482623dd02b12cbf868b3672f75", "2238bd6ef2d3f31f1a3691188a4244f25977a463", "3649fdff0b991e7a5bec42318809c3d50f660690", "18493175642909909196e99b90a6af0bf3ef803b", "5d3f1f994b02caa71f5de58c280e7955caa9732b", "47d86a8d29251fffb1a5d87fde734cab379664d1", "c4facaf3edb3a02c449101e376027a10fd18b946", "df87bf632391b0067577989fdb7d2c4ea88b941d", "e57c43673df5df88653c99373635e734fd03ebb5", "1804a0ddf15743613edfcbab22668a7e8a4d716e", "41a88a490d7ba9e383ecb16c4290083413a08258"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1f405cec6bc8f270b182a62051a8ac04e05ebb0c", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~sbasu/research/papers/pbh.aaai06.pdf", "http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~honavar/Papers/JyotishAAAI-2006.pdf", "http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~honavar/Papers/JyotishAAAI-2006.pdf", "http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~sbasu/research/papers/pbh.aaai06.pdf", "http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~jpathak/AAAI-2006.pdf", "http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~jpathak/publications_files/AAAI-2006.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Workshops/2006/WS-06-01/WS06-01-006.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI 2006", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "44-51", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2602260680", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Our approach is based on introducing inequality constraints associated with datapoints that match the advice. These constrained datapoints can be standard examples in the training set, but can also be unlabeled data in a semi-supervised, advice-taking approach. Our new approach is simpler to implement and more efficiently solved than the knowledge-based support vector classification methods of Fung, Mangasarian and Shavlik (2002; 2003) and the knowledge-based support vector regression method of Mangasarian, Shavlik, and Wild (2004), while performing approximately as well as these more complex approaches. Experiments using our new approach on a synthetic task and a reinforcement-learning problem within the RoboCup soccer simulator show that our advice-taking method can significantly outperform a method without advice and perform similarly to prior advice-taking, support-vector machines.", "authors": [{"name": "Richard  Maclin", "ids": ["1709927"]}, {"name": "Jude W.

{"id": "28d4312e3dd1003de241e8773274525435bedf66", "title": "Overcoming Barriers to Progress in Multimodal Fusion Research", "text": "Government programs have often led the way in research in information detection, recognition, and extraction technologies. Significant performance improvements have been achieved over the last 20 years in automatic speech recognition, spoken language understanding, text, image, and video retrieval, textual structural and semantic extraction, machine translation, speaker recognition, language recognition, face recognition, video person/object detection and tracking, and other extractive technologies. Performance peaks are being observed in these technologies and the pace of breakthrough algorithmic improvements is slowing. Initial efforts at putting these technologies together into complex applications have involved pipelining with progressive distillation or time lining with limited success. It has become clear that the tightly-coupled fusion of these technologies is the next logical step in the progression towards human-like computational intelligence capabilities. Unfortunately, there have been both multidisciplinary and technical barriers to research and development in the area of multimodal fusion and it has yet to gain significant momentum. The gargantuan amounts of multimedia now appearing on the Internet and elsewhere are necessitating an acceleration of work in this area. We identify challenges that must be overcome to enable critical development and speed progress in multimodal fusion technologies. Multi-Disciplinary Challenges R&D Focus \u2013 The ubiquity of information technology, cell phones, digital cameras, and the Internet have evolved very quickly over the last 10 years. It would have been difficult in 1998 to envision the amount of multimedia data that currently resides on the Internet. Organizations charged with processing these data are still trying to catch up to the information revolution that has taken place. Many unimodal extraction technologies remain immature and continued research is necessary to perfect them. As such, they have remained a focus for R&D efforts. Unfortunately, however, with a few notable exceptions, there have been few efforts addressing research in multimodal fusion technologies \u2013 certainly far less than for individual human language technologies. As a result of this imbalance, integration has remained largely a postresearch process -often relying on loosely-coupled pipelined components. Complex multi-component systems developed in this way tend to suffer from compounded errors. Relatively small errors in components can cause error cascades as they are multiplied by successive imperfect processes. While individual processes may have what seem to be relatively low error rates, overall system performance can be significantly degraded. Increased research in multimodal fusion will expedite the creation of synergistic solutions to important multimedia extraction challenges that will reduce the error cascading effect as well as produce more cohesive information across modalities. Complex integration efforts must address this challenge through information-based solutions that span modalities, domains, and component technologies. Multidisciplinary as well as technological boundaries must be crossed to address the challenges since researchers must begin to design their algorithms to fit into the \u201cbig picture\u201d. As such, there must be a significant amount of communication in the R&D process across areas of expertise. Critical Mass \u2013 While a number of workshops and conferences that address multimodality have been active for some time, the number of researchers focusing on multimodal fusion and the number of new researchers in this area has not grown commensurately with the vast quantities of multimedia data that are being generated. Because of the complexity in creating fusion applications and because these challenges call for the development of \u201crenaissance\u201d researchers, a significant communitybuilding effort needs to be undertaken to create and increase expertise in this area. Cross-domain knowledge must be grown in speech, vision, and natural language processing technologies, and in behavioral and social science. To accelerate the development of the research community, new educational resources need to be created to encourage students and young researchers to gravitate toward this area. Such resources include cross-domain seminars, shared data, shared algorithmic components, and fusion frameworks. These resources combined with a focus on fusion research and applications will help to build a researcher base whose specific expertise is in multimedia information extraction. Technological Challenges Data Resources and Evaluation \u2013 While multimedia data have been mined to create research corpora for unimodal applications research, very little multimodal research corpora currently exist. Evaluation methodologies have previously focused on either component technologies or system usability. Significant infrastructure challenges will need to be overcome to enable the progressive development of multimodal fusion technologies. Significant new resources must be created to enable research, development, and evaluation in multimodal fusion technologies. These include the development of large diverse datasets with complex annotations. The good news is that a great deal of multimedia source data already exists and is readily accessible. However, the reference annotations necessary to make these data useful for multimodal research are lacking. Such annotation data will be challenging and expensive to create since they will necessarily span modalities. Synchronization will be critical to maximizing the utility of these data. Metadata standards and practices are a critical component that must be addressed since the structures for representing and sharing multimodal information will be complex. Commonalities must be identified and standards must be created to enable reuse and to make the development of these resources cost effective. Such standards must necessarily cross technological boundaries. A significant body of work has been created over the last 25 years in the evaluation of component technologies and in usability analysis of end-to-end systems. The evaluation of hybrid technologies presents new challenges. While most simplistically these technologies may be treated as a set of extraction tasks, effective evaluation methodologies will provide important failure analysis feedback. Such feedback will be difficult to extract from tightly coupled component technologies. New metrology research is required to address this challenge. Evaluation effectiveness will be highly dependent on the ground truth that is used to assess algorithm performance. These data must be more accurate than the automatic algorithms that are being tested for evaluation to provide statistically significant results. Given the complexity of multimodal/multimedia tasks, such ground truth will be difficult to create with the necessarily high level of accuracy. New more sophisticated annotation tools that perform much like multimedia analyst tools will need to be created to assist human annotators in creating gold standard information for evaluation. New annotation methodologies will likewise need to be created that help to minimize human error/uncertainty in the evaluation results. Core Fusion Research \u2013 Pipelining and progressive distillation are unfortunately often misinterpreted as fusion. These currently prevalent approaches suffer from cascading errors, missing information, and unresolved discrepancies. Fusion requires early coupling of extraction components that work synergistically towards the creation of information. Multimodal fusion techniques will render these loosely-coupled approaches obsolete for multimedia information extraction. In order for multimodal fusion techniques to be realized, research breakthroughs need to take place so that parallel heterogeneous data sources can be processed synergistically. New research must be carried out to enable the creation of the necessary data-sharing structures between tightly-coupled unimodal components. Extensive research must also be performed in choosing what to fuse and how to fuse it and how to most create the most effective multimodal hybrids. Processing speed and computational complexity will be an issue as component technologies are fused. A combination of novel statistical methods, knowledge and data representation methods, heuristics, and computationally efficient algorithms will be required to create efficient reusable fusion solutions. Driver Applications \u2013 Multimodal fusion research has previously lacked pull from high-impact application needs to motivate and guide research directions. Until recently, this area has suffered from a \u201cchicken and egg\u201d problem as technology customers have struggled with envisioning new ways of working with multimedia data and researchers have struggled with divining the types of multimodal tools that would be useful for these customers. Given the current prominence of multimedia data on the Internet and the creation of early tools to manipulate this data, we can now begin to envision a variety of useful applications. Customers are beginning to talk to researchers about application needs. Key driver applications now need to be defined with both customer and researcher input that will help propel the research forward and create revolutionary multimodal applications.", "authors": [{"name": "John S.

Trajectories of the fingertip movements entering numbers are captured with a 3D position sensor mounted on the tip of the forefinger. Two methods are used for recognizing the gestures of drawing a square and pushing buttons. The first method recognizes the numbers according to the relative positions between the range of the drawn square and pushed points.

The energy consumption to complete the task is minimized by finding the best task matching & scheduling strategy on the precondition that HA agent in the team satisfies the dependence and restriction relation among all sub-tasks with common task. Exhaustive enumeration is traditionally used to achieve global optimization with huge system cost, which possibly leads to search combination explosion. In this paper, team task matching & scheduling algorithm based on genetic algorithm is introduced with simulation examples for its model of HA team. The experiment results show that the algorithm has a comparatively high efficiency in solving problem on team task matching & scheduling.", "authors": [{"name": "Hui-Yi  Liu", "ids": ["30656502"]}, {"name": "Jing-Fen  Chen", "ids": ["118453779"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["6a26e534ebe10b8ca11a352152fcd78b9949cf13", "2e62d1345b340d5fda3b092c460264b9543bc4b5", "48be46bd2339299b2763d7cb6df6364ce9766a19", "f8d745ac401e90fdb9c9e03e0998a757bfeee8e4", "d002b86a442f3417944ad722c057691b51ef304e", "4b4279db68b16e20fbc56f9d41980a950191d30a", "bf16d16b63af38d37ac063b2fe38155f082c25aa", "5a426168ce8f63fe42e718e0c6b309fc4e7fe5b3"], "year": 2008, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4340daa3addf2a07eba7f4e4370482ef60c6b92d", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "4", "journalPages": "2384-2389", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620804", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620804", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2104922660", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

The ANN captures interrelationships within data and the optimization technique estimates probable values that are used as inputs to the ANN. The optimum estimate is one that has a minimum influence on the output of the ANN. A method to determine the confidence of this estimate is presented in this paper. An ensemble of ANNs with a Multi Layer Perceptron architecture is collected using Bayesian training methods. The percentage of the most dominant estimate values is used as a confidence measure.

The main ingredient of our algorithm is the stepwise forward selection algorithm (FSA) due to Deshpande, Garofalakis, and Jordan. EGA is an efficient alternative to the algorithm (HGA) by Malvestuto, which constructs a model of treewidth k by selecting hyperedges of order k+1. In this paper, we present results of empirical studies that compare HGA, EGA and FSA-K which is a straightforward application of FSA, in terms of approximation accuracy (measured by KL-divergence) and computational time. Our experiments show that (1) on the average, all three algorithms produce similar approximation accuracy; (2) EGA produces comparable or better approximation accuracy and is the most efficient among the three. (3) Malvestuto's algorithm is the least efficient one, although it tends to produce better accuracy when the treewidth is bigger than half of the number of random variabls; (4) EGA coupled with local search has the best approximation accuracy overall, at a cost of increased computation time by 50 percent.", "authors": [{"name": "Guoli  Ding", "ids": ["38985109"]}, {"name": "Robert F.

To improve the performance of ACE, we have improved the weighting method, which combines the outputs of classifiers, and have added a new classifier pruning method. Experimental results showed that the enhanced ACE performed well for a synthetic dataset that contained both sudden and gradual changes and recurring concepts.", "authors": [{"name": "Kyosuke  Nishida", "ids": ["2963420"]}, {"name": "Koichiro  Yamauchi", "ids": ["144481760"]}], "inCitations": ["5393866f47bc4171ab9ab326869dadeeef368ae7", "6b63e1a7547963b3ad8651af12fd5291f3118dad", "3f9a7c8929a563d5d57c6c5dde4005b5807f306a", "17592e77ab792ca72f2d8af9c5089b5b2740a543", "36dbf57c49f0f4ef0e57e758094af5c707f0d879", "14c25cd896ca5503093e111624041ea5773a38ad", "ae47b53815e43ba8a8c451e3c609eb4858976e5e", "37f3e2c62947fab621d6974884a0c2d40bbb9792", "e7a04b9bbc7bf6206018ef4a79c33d9b40fce1c2", "7f19fc0f7b963438f7dc172670e921128e774e28", "1ce1119562f871beab87a128f526072b2d3a7da4", "edb7190e53bee64f73aa777c024b40853bad104e", "53b622d632096ab8060aaf87c9d2f6aa68951e40", "5ac16295da09990a7e3b966bd27611a2666377fd", "ed698fd7a4ca267a0279cabdf412db7f6632009f", "595a499ba9c6d113d8ba194f54a2d1e78c3980bd", "a75ca9e67838e18136720d1f2a9254eb9bf81e28", "eda51528050c02926c8efe74b15fa9ab15573d3d", "9f80ffbe1c7707bf93b2b587e32d71794212babb", "e21830006f16498b58c2a618730b6dcad9ac7f03", "b4e16658d7f564bcfec78f34214bcbc70a765706", "1a4c6c68b3e3d53b725c05300bb802942a445142", "24bbd9e01a9ac44521ac0fe16f77463d2c0849d0", "0d8050862918c220a96c45ba49f3c1639cfde4fc", "30bd33720718b678fb55ea6cd2c2abeed9fe2466", "308647f22e3f1c80b7416b3c53fd56f9abfa904f", "9c9d2f75d8e9bb8f3d6f20adc94d5dd89906ed40", "54e1378c54e44c71852b4d20c06efe1626b3214e", "1abddaf0fcd465f1fb53934d962386d671858f0d", "b32d65b6208eb581f46b6908225e90513312ad86", "71153848fde857205c6c332eb04dd8c2dfdc55bf", "2de48c7005f9bd27459590618e083902e8568f1c", "39fb4307926c0e167c7b3a13b8493ea9ce088392", "0a042691cbfa8862792a28b4f4c1b9d341e90b5b", "339c100890acf87e8d12f0d7f991df60a89555a1", "12b483d9b3ed6c50a4992204b91077623666371c", "d0e5446ed3e21c1dfa6bded812f6e32ff22e22ec", "38f2e8cf9c0e257dbbacb5d20b2101103fb80f47", "9c02267c843eb56c638bb406f525a17292e86dce", "ef4a3ab869f569f7dbb86584f267b00acf3ee83a", "f739cfd54547cdc2c14b01bc43aaf8af95cbdf1c", "90d7d352a654f70645a68b7c3c13104b40943904", "c760518b36c88f008dacea3684ea0bb60022ae7e", "e7146cadcc438c25491c010849ac25f9d3aeb3d3", "241fc7f988fbfe5bbf3d7cfdb9d3fa5a82405c93", "7f090f1cadf4ccab776a74aa57cd45f96f67bad8", "306635885ce0f5726a299a9483819d00c7fc2de5", "497b826f7bddc616ca8c6564fd57ab598340ef69", "eee60a101d385402fdca538b0734b5073ef110f0", "2c6ca3b5ebb4e47f3c72afdeb65563830261735a"], "outCitations": ["8fb1b96dcc133b170e7e5b340f93c5f230d495ee", "83cdbbfad2d4bb4c348e09cf3db779f020809b05", "b14f4269f09ef77ad310581ea82d502402d90fb9", "7f5ce28afc0c2eafd4a6ef711e399bee4056c3b8", "bfbdc3374125aa4ae76951d0ee352c15d02f33cf", "4611af8dfe3f1d7a4b08854a1b73becbe9c1bef4", "30eac73e9b482bc28b5b68cd585557de48d0618f", "b9af2664693edb7b5586b181af6de74ef44a45ef", "bc416c3e4f5cc637921346d4869834ec39f58fd9", "ba10c37a6a24276f5e67a22a71d0d511c01cf5e1", "59bb8d6c3eec8f925710db4d2488e2a23167d3e8", "9a42cf92c63401a1553e8650bbfde9f87b0b6e76", "b28e19dd46f55511251cfbe99da9dbb827c4ca4a", "4ba566223e426677d12a9a18418c023a4deec77e", "7d4642da036febe5174da1390521444ef405c864", "3695a1a67a56b3d4a45d0f7d6f3b8baecd803d42", "c1a880d5f744d2d26b2ab404e7b60791632edd3c"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1deeafb996c7768af24a616fa8354a8234a921ca", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "6", "journalPages": "3607-3612", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370772", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370772", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2084901303", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Thus, in order to manage a knowledge discovery project, a team of different experts is worth being constituted. In this paper we analyze the Collaborative Knowledge Discovery in Databases environment in terms of the different information team workers need to exchange to collaborate, surveying the main existing technologies for information representation and exchange, and enlightening possible directions of future work.

The fusing results on Ikonos MS + Pan data demonstrate that the proposed image fusion method is effective and efficient.", "authors": [{"name": "Sheng  Zheng", "ids": ["49654590"]}, {"name": "Wenzhong  Shi", "ids": ["2127846"]}, {"name": "Jian  Liu", "ids": ["46700855"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["80fb68a6db94266b6b90a9cd0f887074a9d10068", "22e65c10b0e084c1d5f5bd8ea9f5bdd00b23725d", "7614a8c270f70f3cbc5f7c6aff0b9211e8c36772", "7abc75bd345c756c1993a4116bf199a390e3ffcd", "cc98decd850a4fe0d054b0d9bb661b082951e427", "f182d6d81fbce2983b6f83708ba480ab70b58789", "ccce1cf96f641b3581fba6f4ce2545f4135a15e3", "cde90579cbee3ce13f7f86027821183024ca1e92", "4645e92479ebf466360bdefe684581d5d3682d1a", "a93485ceb9b6756739dc513daa266f0bbaa5872c", "c45594d22c806c89f5a1c533ef21fd699e2fd9b5", "4c32109533faaeb123a02965a281de5e4791f1d8", "410da8e51d4963fef3f76604877179e6838ad29c", "391a6ee9e597dc221161434d56992f20eb3eb5d2", "5ba9eeb46f04eba62bb5a6c551386efe6296b19e", "89b716e6dfb3a6124b69fbbbd2baaa7930e0f40e"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9313e5f26361d9a184eaf2863ca96a1b8433c997", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "3", "journalPages": "1584-1589", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370398", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370398", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2012776851", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

We believe that non-systematic but greedy inference is an interesting research direction for powerful proof systems such as general resolution.", "authors": [{"name": "Steven David Prestwich", "ids": ["1709865"]}, {"name": "In\u00eas  Lynce", "ids": ["1773888"]}], "inCitations": ["f17611ac5769db71b5026ef5fb19bab3055754e8", "2710be3ecf1e09a4ef0871d9562b6c45d4c209a5"], "outCitations": ["067c4fcf15402636f5e7d69ef80318f55625becd", "be2bf8070aee7197c2c60e9a37f6d3463f106569", "9507f4ab47833b61d3b2cfca436245c4608ffebd", "0ec949fc37fae70c904293f2f8f3173ab9f9d399", "ed16895022621b8342cc3a7d185e969f049f749a", "7dbf4c5424c676f7e04010a0a6678cab40e71332", "ca659cef501cbffff56f9984819cb1bde7d433f4", "86855def4461dcf4054e65cec88e5695f09d0f6d", "38ca1364d9cc64667d6a3dea5bc4ae002124e270", "ea1d451f713fccec520060267820723c2240148c", "feca806dc20be4a72a57b45b9ce7ebfcded08038", "b016000a21bd719027cdae123feb66fc41b0c44e", "8b10f88a9b6112a2ba574916b576ec1d82120a73", "076def1d7b6b0bece14d3ebf493f26abe2177907", "1bc85bbbe0f67dd26f7a8d4993833f875ca9d1c9", "1f8729c0cfc09dae60170b83e6112c19bde7c625", "d2109eba4f160755f0b9a7497b6b691c2fa2d5d8", "7088cc21be1d163373fce5674d9d4d14dee38237"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/02186d8320298f643e4c1fe68266eea8446e92e1", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2007/AAAI07-269.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2007/aaai07-269.php", "http://www.inesc-id.pt/ficheiros/publicacoes/4016.pdf", "http://sat.inesc-id.pt/~ines/publications/aaai07.pdf", "http://sat.inesc.pt/~ines/publications/aaai07.pdf", "http://4c.ucc.ie/web/dist_papers/Steve1.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1667-1670", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "123712525", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Crucial to the performance of any sequence alignment algorithm is an accurate model of the reward of transforming one sequence into another. Using this model, we can find the optimal alignment of two sequences or perform query-based selection from a database of target sequences with a dynamic programming approach. In this paper, we describe a new algorithm to learn the reward models from positive and negative examples of matching sequences. We develop a gradient boosting approach that reduces sequence learning to a series of standard function approximation problems that can be solved by any function approximator. A key advantage of this approach is that it is able to induce complex features using function approximation rather than relying on the user to predefine such features. Our experiments on synthetic data and a fairly complex real-world music retrieval domain demonstrate that our approach can achieve better accuracy and faster learning compared to a state-of-the-art structured SVM approach.", "authors": [{"name": "Charles  Parker", "ids": ["145036712"]}, {"name": "Alan  Fern", "ids": ["145841336"]}, {"name": "Prasad  Tadepalli", "ids": ["1729906"]}], "inCitations": ["85eb796cee0a987eba2f5b6057525af9422378f0", "cc24138804e8ab2b293f5c11ce6c44ffeaf1cb9a", "ecca01ded9554c7a4df15e5c9f2294801184662e", "e5ce3b5dee686d19fe9ab535240ae169ec16e4ac", "c863565f9ef45687a58f0407cb859bd66785a102", "d36b98095e8d7b25f562520630473f2fe6858ba0", "ded19607f0b46732beb30c945bef17d6df73106c", "b3dddb2de4d35c2ad217c0223bd029e9161c2507", "ae8e4ea4b4d1510832abbf96b413988ba34ebde4", "76224c91f66df50026b62dd2f6f95eecbc405cfc", "fe8b9cd027d98f358ca10c6a4e0d31bbd38e986a", "03c92afef3b422e3c0825d9ab65b9de12d23a655", "4952e5f8d3c5d76d7a98846461fcd5aca0bce206", "fd54605593dd3ab5f5ebf779a478efac8ffb479f", "5ce1a86d58c6b6741f9e01b2209839570e81ab9e", "f4961d3b6591adadf3cd4c878d36a052a29bc1f2", "fb41fd661aef336b8d48d8e8316c76ca04f0fa5d", "bd8e8e54dc75be4b6ad19199711607f4ac65cbd8", "42c0aeb469aada7220c67ece177dbaa22827ce24", "07295d6836d8fadd4150328d33659e5022fccc2f", "73ae7d260914358c74e2bcf504c97a44e1b4a23b"], "outCitations": ["40c5441aad96b366996e6af163ca9473a19bb9ad", "af43b7358ec0d84c0473656ad90f968a7a7e27f6", "d771e343711ccebe602cde596341b955da7b6d42", "ad3ffab9b6e534bf5c9bd454535659ce7ecc2868", "bab1997d1b1f4fcac975be08e1561993cfa982f8", "fb7828edee96c2ca39cca045aeebc77c1e7aaf0a", "5d28fc1a4027d23cc9e4ad8555361d48940e9be8", "93aa298b40bb3ec23c25239089284fdf61ded917", "665987c6132fd9862580188457f7d4a7185a3541", "385197d4c02593e2823c71e4f90a0993b703620e", "f3dfabb696a6761e32b21be87f530dbe1f9f83df", "0c450531e1121cfb657be5195e310217a4675397", "f4ba954b0412773d047dc41231c733de0c1f4926", "8fe2ea0a67954f1380b3387e3262f1cdb9f9b3e5", "011b9ca48aa1e0ad9ee9481668ef43f6dc4d2383", "277c2139eb4e11455a0b16759b7249c3b95b479e"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ffa77a072c2f1c98ef626c45630147620705991f", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2006/AAAI06-072.pdf", "http://www.cs.orst.edu/~afern/papers/aaai06-align.pdf", "http://www.cs.orst.edu/~tadepall/research/papers/aaai06-align.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2006/aaai06-72.php", "http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tadepall/research/papers/aaai06-align.pdf", "http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tadepall/papers/aaai06-align.pdf", "http://cs.oregonstate.edu/~tadepall/research/papers/aaai06-align.pdf", "http://www.clparker.org/parker-grad.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "452-457", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1792924715", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Conventional PID controller with double close-loops has been used in speed control of separately excited DC motor at present. But under conditions of actual operation we find that it isn't suitable for the high performance cases, because of the low robustness of conventional PID controller. In order to overcome these problems, we propose the idea of fuzzy self-adaptive PID control method under fuzzy control theory and design a DSP-based cascaded control system to regulate speed of DC motor. The MATLAB 7.0 is used as simulation tool to establish the simulation model and the simulation analysis combined with fuzzy toolbox. It obtains the best parameter through simulation combined with experience and from the simulation result we can see the practicality and validity of this control method and solve the problems mentioned above", "authors": [{"name": "Yu-Long  Gui", "ids": ["144716784"]}, {"name": "Hai-Long  Lu", "ids": ["7182618"]}, {"name": "Jian-Bo  Fan", "ids": ["2021888"]}], "inCitations": ["2bc9c3ad68e00a7fa9370db7c1c5f833539fae81", "01aac2e454acab178d6bd84f89ea407a54c6d936", "ca6c9311a6300431fb0c63cf56d37d9460615be2", "5210f280168237cbac4f43ff938802e053b17e27", "043477fbe5d5b85a6b266b57fa0f8d00267d7fee", "c6f0af0a0bcdbc6bb9f91311542291fbb77df3b4"], "outCitations": ["61037be58cc6af5f276c6c3e7a16445f62511e22", "02fb8b09eefaf9fe06e158724c45f2e62e35de46", "dd6e2a82b98349dbaf2730d5ccd8f5a977fa7aa4", "f2042187ac80ae278ccb33d97c11c65a623d65c6", "4b600a5e206c5104873355d44dbcee827160d16e", "8d84d7a6f01a8cae7540b4507692bc10a924c7e6", "7a5f50204de5425c044d5b038bc23e50e04837fe"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ca7e1317efd4bbe8a56aafb13370d0bcb36d28fd", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2006 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2006 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "655-660", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258394", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258394", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2121904613", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Recommender systems typically use techniques from collaborative filtering, in which proximity measures between users are formulated to generate recommendations, or content-based filtering, in which users are compared directly to items. Our approach uses similarity measures between users, but also directly measures the attributes of items that make them appealing to specific users. This can be used to directly make recommendations to users, but equally importantly it allows these recommendations to be justified. We introduce a method for predicting the preference of a user for a movie by estimating the user's attitude toward features with which other users have described that movie. \n \nWe show that this method allows for accurate recommendations for a sub-population of users, but not for the entire user population. We describe a hybrid approach in which a user-specific recommendation mechanism is learned and experimentally evaluated. It appears that such a recommender system can achieve significant improvements in accuracy over alternative methods, while also retaining other advantages.", "authors": [{"name": "Matthew  Garden", "ids": ["31570423"]}, {"name": "Gregory  Dudek", "ids": ["1798721"]}], "inCitations": ["8b002a38fa8b1b45208e31382327958cc4e230b4", "1b401d58899423fecb6be3d77a4770f30f980130", "06dd9c35a29530afc918c6a44ebbc46fa00e0f74", "0f6ccd9547ad43dbd5448696f150b829450b6b10", "1af61ffaaeafb46e3bb53e0fde3db8f01fbdc4a7", "224bcdbbda1a55f4a8d9b62496bba74c72d20a36", "af6936f634102cadfe2e8cec260fc0d8fbf3b36e", "44f069904227f3b2357eb238c343c5047b79749d", "9f023f3786dea98f5b610dd0a6e16c643aec4eb8", "bf6572d5f347f1ca41adc528860d7eda1750cec6", "1e6b0c387c62b3dfdde8b8226fc206e41e72e7d9", "bdd5a88cc1e4ca72d43010e8fcab0fb9d46f7bbb", "8a7ea22786bd4355a784d9c1b55127f370a02816", "1911c2355bfaa2d2267df76260689093d52f872a", "50361d7dfff1430f0578172bd431ea9259b56c62", "fe5261a8b5178beca3a038c6f315a096a3f75490", "4e5fa40ad94811141a7d7237890d76458c2184ec", "e45f4c576efa5e5155de2e8b2489085541943a5d", "53850e18a58a83e47ce4a37b74b305301e8d4352", "44ab477f847dd5d830675a166420ace3aec0da6e", "1db24adc8ebf9a21534aa06788b293fd99a89e96", "3c28aa52cea130790aa12a58123e77142b7af173", "8b6136b471401384f8f67190a373ce77acfec6d7", "5e4714a5184d804cede5bdcf9fbb600248a4fdcd", "0363d87ccd0daf229e10acca542cb31c8ab34089", "36752ba5a03c648a5c9f2f9750e83bd7d656b376", "15df3d72e769dd494b385fd5db18cb49221b3290"], "outCitations": ["e032a6e6879ace7b7a790901b535165cb64ba028", "82e0eb4da73d3c89e2022797c376b9a46b96ab59", "5880b9bc3f75f4649b8ec819c3f983a14fca9927", "294759853b9dc077fe019d8d714c6574b495839f", "a51b7816d47a3985328531fdac8ca8a902fc6fb5", "dbdabdf9e653e11eb4d44f69f645a564622220b3", "6aa1c88b810825ee80b8ed4c27d6577429b5d3b2", "3882cfca774a26c3b0572fc5123f4eacc066aef8", "fe9cd9ab8bcc110847a8a4792134e4917fd7e933", "565f003d7f373fa073967a44fa3dd4355a7280ef", "92cc12f272ff55795c29cd97dc8ee17a5554308e", "333b5c0f2b750f737b725496e2b75a6330f5cc54", "c834bddd5e75a64ca9bb80c195cf84345c38bb9b", "a3c9fb5f446aaaffd5510aeff8a16db36b264e7f", "ccb523816192dcec0062e396bef9ae08a1ad3e59", "1e9f4095cae47278455cec6a45a8801cbb1c0f3c", "c6ca4c2912db0708f6df1ad1525746915d392a45", "6f7f94ce7dfe6eb4f95a472107d56549e03ae1ab", "36b4a92c8eca6fd6d1b8588fc1fd0e3f89a16623", "468b516de9f2edbbe8822a96e0906455c41e9323", "21cefe0b5fbd4a7bd258d25255f6bfce4dca3306"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a75cc2fa2e9cf256f966f3dee7ef58e25be9f07e", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2006/AAAI06-205.pdf", "http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~mrl/pubs/mgarden/AAAI06GardenM.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2006/aaai06-205.php", "http://www.cim.mcgill.edu/~mrl/pubs/mgarden/AAAI06GardenM.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1307-1312", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "189385330", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

This paper presents a novel approach of single neuron PID model reference adaptive control (MRAC) control based on RBF neural network on-line identification. A RBF network is built to identify the system on-line, and then it constructs the on-line reference model, implements self-learning of controller parameters by single neuron controller, and thus achieves on-line regulation of controller's parameters. The simulation result shows that the proposed method can construct processing model through on-line identification and then give gradient information to neuron controller, it can achieve on-line identification and on-line control with high control accuracy and good dynamic performance", "authors": [{"name": "Ming-Guang  Zhang", "ids": ["40426233"]}, {"name": "Wen-Hui  Li", "ids": ["40400195"]}], "inCitations": ["c6c8f2ac90b509c5dd89a561a001d3dc12932584", "285ca623a21a95463a77701152362d2487d5c1a8", "6ec3d757363a50c1aa3009dfab22cb87cdee0a2b", "dc7f3bb719f98ad518e43c843ec3df414bef7052", "a30a61d2cafad71a85743681733e88ca8c5a7543", "1d19bff4e3dca7342bc73172d38ca5f48e39c03f", "972b9cc51a13e4a11b33f978761d306db31d2b5a", "a32ace8268f8747e2fd4bd01b1019a1316185b84", "8efa9873195f2eb6711b250b8abff94c6f8d62d6", "4fe2a40795a0d1dfa4dafca92f9a533fa2beee39", "b2fd9b71748472d5063bec3e4c3dbd6e01d53372", "ac587cf4c58a262dff5f6f5c68c2b4cad7e92541", "726fee19ce79153c3257801626648dac5c5dc4a5", "d407e56a9375f0bbc08ce0e32001a81cea40c07f", "fbc6b3429f5fc31b254615b792930e8ce3b11e44", "60df76b32fa5df462a541250c0cc8c89ffcac7d8", "54c2d5b6efddb4a8395ca503052ad505060f150e", "2b67aa0beeaa5d31378cdad6c5fce2aae094020b", "360f281d96a5d3c9ec98aa7338dc735412fd94ce", "bdb00ee21f36abf7e5cb51cdc6511ca8d819e892", "6cc4542800c2d4ed8b04031acaadf353a6bf2026", "4ecd0893bf98bbfb9373c7d22530bd453a70febc", "1cae3040317c4a139ca2967e8412bcee5e56fa1f", "ee6d10924e157159e0bc01bb7119ea3a71de5dd8", "3cc85904c7493f0adcb67df6c1160490a672ccfa", "2d556c3538467dfc4812619c4b1b2bb028697e21", "0f79d904f45a07a072b44a798682d0f60a9621cf", "60d8c4ba537c484c3dd8297344a415df0d6890c8", "d226e9729b40d5c69a6ae7af56d22001dbecdfbf", "588090ec135109ae69191b583b041ca9c72526cc", "e4cf169fed06e36d16768d999d70a17ffa7e7f1e"], "outCitations": ["657de1b5da8a7d6efbd71aae4292ac6c35d66605", "a87e4f910c6fe08cf2f52c3cb65ed0c49f67f143", "2355fdccf000ea4322df9b83cb4986122f6b9b07", "05df5d4ae7b6460831318f0a7ea0b6db771aebde", "43f8247f335bc03992a16ae137e4248acbbecfe9", "802445eff55f209683d1a45c3008ea23b414caea", "e918c204dd9339966658a37ad13ae1b0181bb76f", "d5558a34dfd1dbb572895664d38fca04029a99cb", "16f6a2b2c24c6fd9278c18553ed6eef90963210b", "b5734235a619fdab8c6ce9d3c9a0dfb7b9c66143", "bae0962e7d2a4cba203d71ab39e5569db36ba9b0", "2133b8c69d71b89dd18e8e9e8b38059fe6be88a0", "b08ba914037af6d88d16e2657a65cd9dc5cf5da1", "56d7e86fbe786ab3c973c32d54ee0f2dd93f0d26", "5263bfffc3122c383ba60f7fa486427235404f9f"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/920b5abcda1a178de78a8c56a82812cd9e6458d3", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://read.pudn.com/downloads586/doc/2401008/04028581.pdf"], "venue": "2006 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2006 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "3021-3025", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258358", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258358", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2162640281", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

This characteristic can be exploited with designing efficient search algorithms. This paper proposes an algorithm to change each new node connecting to the network based on its high-degree-probability for equal-degree-probability ,after having constituted initial model by choosing high-degree-probability nodes.

Analytic and simulation results showed that rule-based reasoning acts much like uses the concept of absolute accuracy. Instance-based inferring method uses relative accuracy to identify varied difficult levels in words. Since scoring a word's difficulty via absolute accuracy is not always applicable, the grading system accomplished the task by the instance-based approach. After checking for consistency by using the joint entrance examination center (JEEC) testing data in Taiwan, we summarize as follows: 1) The information system has the capability to answer the difficulty level of a word. 2) The system can persistently professionalize itself via the supervised learning approach.

Recently, Goyal and Egenhofer proposed a formal model, called Cardinal Direction Calculus (CDC), for representing direction relations between connected plane regions. CDC is perhaps the most expressive qualitative calculus for directional information, and has attracted increasing interest from areas such as artificial intelligence, geographical information science, and image retrieval. Given a network of CDC constraints, the consistency problem is deciding if the network is realizable by connected regions in the real plane. This paper provides a cubic algorithm for checking consistency of basic CDC constraint networks. As one by product, we also show that any consistent network of CDC constraints has a canonical realization in digital plane. The cubic algorithm can also been adapted to cope with disconnected regions, in which case the current best algorithm is of time complexity O(n5).", "authors": [{"name": "Xiaotong  Zhang", "ids": ["2987792"]}, {"name": "Weiming  Liu", "ids": ["9168729"]}, {"name": "Sanjiang  Li", "ids": ["1682240"]}, {"name": "Mingsheng  Ying", "ids": ["144662679"]}], "inCitations": ["7e74f5a8314d454c36a3636c72d88deb9cf9a24a", "2d55b3946d09cfa97285965da7511998222a6faf", "d4dbe69b345e034ce32f32d64484888f2429d9e8", "80b9498367d2de2ce63327eb925f0c69ae3b53ae", "ed50cfac14a7e0821889ce36c30cc3a1802b1867", "b3c4426d8f8874b90835a12db2f3f11c747b4dbb", "56c1190110e593767e7d26604bc7ba128753692a", "510d98e7a6e01667afadabb51c6f674d03c6d209", "6db1dfa5078e264fb292fffd4e7d3ee217293234", "a48c3861e5b446f3326e814bdfd94629a5d9776d", "31fc6794828b304dad4ecbdb9d7ac89a5f47f312", "ae0a54b997813b888c3c195809f313cd41873c52", "7091f112606aea0a77c627a3aecc6b2b579eb27b", "b13f4b7877301b602bf6eaf615ec06b22e7c5abb", "ee847d4c34145b68a071b5507650a2bd65a03f89", "ad8278244efcc75b81b6776ca6cf3b8d7c47c05e"], "outCitations": ["441c00de99dacdacb6718733de76ac2068a35d07", "f4d642d674aa63aafc11562c2557cb4772946147", "959ca49fe4b2e2b2f59b9c69911223e660ce706c", "20402c3f0941a8d2ed57dcd9dc27475037febbe8", "5bb4576b3c06a2800f372efd0c8215343ac5d758", "3c07bd94ca7c80bf19e5a3de999ff7406a416e01", "59ac1d3e866a47cc7113a596cd821dab61544466", "d03f9a09667d70bd73daae596aa13dd045e56e93", "c80f724b06a29b0e9babf4a73ae063fe9d376bd3", "b4b6343318366653bcbcee76085f4fe3b66a5c7f", "31f687621abfb19bcbe8c60c477b209e17e33bbf", "a09386cfa0834a4b804bb66c542423e8db744cd6", "59c930daefb778bddc0439d316af72169f2161f6", "de933857875e843c3d217eaae0253543e69191de", "64ae9aeadd24d51d4b95a8fbad21eb92fd4f5be4"], "year": 2008, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/984e9de2a97062e37f664a5b762ec6f73c9eaa61", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2008/AAAI08-061.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2008/aaai08-061.php"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "387-392", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2135858744", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Learned vocabularies of kinematic motion primitives are used emulate the function of hypothesized neuroscientific models for spinal fields and mirror neurons in the process of imitation. For imitation, we assume the movement of a demonstrator is produced through a \u201cvirtual trajectory\u201d specifying desired body poses over time. Each pose represents a decomposition into mirror neuron firing coefficients that specify the attractive dynamics to this configuration through a linear combination of primitives. Each primitive is a nonlinear dynamical system that predicts expected motion with respect to an underlying activity. Our aim is to invert this process by estimating a demonstrator\u2019s virtual trajectory from monocular image observations in a bottom-up fashion.

This is why, for instance, tractable inference procedures are known for certain classes of description logics and for (some) formalisms underlying knowledge representation on the Semantic Web. Some traditions within artificial intelligence and knowledge representation have focused on more expressive knowledge representations. For some expressive representations, such as first-order logic, sound and complete proof calculi, such as the sequent calculus, have been developed. However, for the purposes of automated theorem proving, not all proof calculi are created equal. Engineering effective proof search strategies for some proof calculi is difficult, but other proof calculi, e.g., those based on resolution, do lend themselves to efficient proof search. Recognizing the diversity of knowledge representation systems currently in existence, the different properties of proof calculi which may be employed over these systems, and the growing need to combine inferences made under multiple logical systems, we propose the development of formalisms to govern these interactions, and call this the study of combined logics.", "authors": [{"name": "Joshua  Taylor", "ids": ["144961345"]}, {"name": "Selmer  Bringsjord", "ids": ["1797985"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["2fb53291ac932ba3f51807daee0a7acb66b690bb", "4489f3684557a855eca93768fed63205ea00847b"], "year": 2008, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8091e0e03f43b63768aa345129507f40a85ca0df", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~tayloj/DOCS/PUBS/2008.11.08_DiscoveryUsingHeterogeneousCombinedLogics.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Fall/2008/FS-08-03/FS08-03-009.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/2008/fs08-03-009.php"], "venue": "AAAI Fall Symposium: Automated Scientific Discovery", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "30-", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2406159044", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

As a result, real-time heuristic methods are becoming more wide-spread in practice. These algorithms typically conduct a limited-depth lookahead search and evaluate the states at the frontier using a heuristic. Actions selected by such methods can be suboptimal due to the incompleteness of their search and inaccuracies in the heuristic. Lookahead pathologies occur when a deeper search decreases the chances of selecting a better action. Over the last two decades research on lookahead pathologies has focused on minimax search and small synthetic examples in single-agent search. As real-time search methods gain ground in applications, the importance of understanding and remedying lookahead pathologies increases. This paper, for the first time, conducts a large scale investigation of lookahead pathologies in the domain of real-time path-finding. We use maps from commercial computer games to show that deeper search often not only consumes additional in-game CPU cycles but also decreases path quality. As a second contribution, we suggest three explanations for such pathologies and support them empirically. Finally, we propose a remedy to lookahead pathologies via a method for dynamic lookahead depth selection. This method substantially improves on-line performance and, as an added benefit, spares the user from having to tune a control parameter.", "authors": [{"name": "Vadim  Bulitko", "ids": ["1884952"]}, {"name": "Mitja  Lustrek", "ids": ["1723535"]}], "inCitations": ["d9e2211dfe840550fd03433e892b01c8e265a2f2", "ba1eb4ff75330662862dec4be4ffabf4acb8d4ae", "2375df8e19a43ecc3e2de1040cd87774e0da9818", "6593e461abec5432727b8c70bb166078cc3cd330", "a57f3af7a4ec394d640fa36d60836dda6231a599", "3cef2524b0e0b274750f5ea9bde996498aa9072c", "07c1e17bd96383124ece5e74a94e1ad0c2492ffa", "210631fe03dafd2548bdd0acf1a1a9a47de7b97a", "45c36d334f27feaeaa2bdfe30a2a39550b1d4a73", "8c52aaecb1cf994ebd9f8d2f9526c1874f8b8df7", "f1a6e28340659430eab5e58e3d79ab23fdd99dc7", "1bf7f1aa05bb353246e77dd7f9e557e2d1a544ac", "e30534b4d1b1bd496a6712532d9ec12a17c0ddb2", "43d7a26da04e1bafa3316fe085c8fd670ae673d1", "c3293febd33a5c498571d76b6ee1637a260c817c", "6fac67f9eea903b591916f742bbd26dd9d0aef29", "a511a2934aa5debf327043a9ebab91ec511fcace", "8febdc96b224f9687c69e4a43d758b2a8a1cbb88", "eae2e4ef98f550c207ca0891d7370b52c876d701", "53da93a3d6494cf152bf7efe76087548f777e1b1", "5a71cabe9de9d423e2800597081e1e7cefda0b35", "407ca94f8bb1cb7d5deadab318fedd951f1d8453", "bd71628e70c0c520614b09e55dba08f2c06d5290"], "outCitations": ["8edd5ab14f089076a01d07d161efbea35d32954d", "72c4e6427d2a119a7973e8c44a75fddfd76d3601", "bfb1b8e807dcdfe1200e3a485f928ee732d075d0", "2fda10f6079156c4621fefc8b7cad72c1829ee94", "016f0b1016a7112cc83f3745200de2473bc45ced", "9576f18de25d37a755836c10353f451085d72c9b", "f71786bad3dafeafb65b4672123f3767b1e2dc15", "90d08e63a1f33fd70f3f84aa88e08a0d368db0af", "5e538b5604aa6c39b785140461ed7b1fdc88600b", "7b9c35f511cf66f8631d3b12828b1d874f9d2428", "cae7716d9109049f66030ddaa5a9dbfa03408285", "1ab44f17ccf9227c7b938a66f6dea03bd21943ff", "e9401730d1e731c63dbf058b06393ba5ebf05a28", "4bb3527c87a86a8351bc09ae57c01cbb4446b027", "c174d753210f91e9207483142753b7d30342f557"], "year": 2006, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/51657ed77a8db4f002817e0a8aed3ee09efb1a44", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://dis.ijs.si/mitjal/documents/bulitko-lookahead_pathology_in_real-time_path-finding-aaai-06-mp.pdf", "http://ircl.cs.ualberta.ca/files/webfm/lrts/pubs/AAAI0605BulitkoV.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/2006/aaai06-370.php", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Workshops/2006/WS-06-11/WS06-11-017.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2006/AAAI06-370.pdf", "http://dis.ijs.si/MitjaL/documents/Lookahead_Pathology_in_Real-Time_Path-Finding-AAAI-06-LfS-poster.pdf", "http://dis.ijs.si/MitjaL/documents/Lookahead_Pathology_in_Real-Time_Path-Finding-AAAI-06-LfS.pdf", "http://dis.ijs.si/mitjal/documents/Lookahead_Pathology_in_Real-Time_Path-Finding-AAAI-06-LfS.pdf", "https://dis.ijs.si/MitjaL/documents/Lookahead_Pathology_in_Real-Time_Path-Finding-AAAI-06-LfS-poster.pdf", "http://dis.ijs.si/MitjaL/documents/Bulitko-Lookahead_Pathology_in_Real-Time_Path-Finding-AAAI-06-MP.pdf", "http://dis.ijs.si/MitjaL/documents/Bulitko-Lookahead_Pathology_in_Real-Time_Path-Finding-AAAI-06-MP-poster.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "27158770", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

In difficult retrieval tasks, however, one needs access to a wealth of background knowledge. We present a method that uses Wikipedia-based feature generation to improve retrieval performance. Intuitively, we expect that using extensive world knowledge is likely to improve recall but may adversely affect precision. High quality feature selection is necessary to maintain high precision, but here we do not have the labeled training data for evaluating features, that we have in supervised learning. We present a new feature selection method that is inspired by pseudorelevance feedback. We use the top-ranked and bottom-ranked documents retrieved by the bag-of-words method as representative sets of relevant and non-relevant documents. The generated features are then evaluated and filtered on the basis of these sets. Experiments on TREC data confirm the superior performance of our method compared to the previous state of the art.", "authors": [{"name": "Ofer  Egozi", "ids": ["1875787"]}, {"name": "Evgeniy

It's important and significant to perform load transfer for improving the service reliability of distribution network and decreasing outage loss. However, distribution load transfer operation was mostly completed by manual work and experience in the past. Several analysis program modules, such as network analysis and connectivity analysis, are adopt to deal with outage of distribution network on the basis of distribution GIS. The power flow is stored in the database as the attributes of line switches for load transfer analysis. When a system outage such as fault and overload occurs, the load transfer is then executed to find the switches to be operated by the reactive Tabu Search (RTS) method while subjected to the system operation rules. By the proposed method, using the program modules, the network topology can be updated according to switches status. Since all the system facilities are stored in the GIS database according to the actual spatial coordinates, it provides practical information for the system operators and crews to allocate and operate switches easily. Finally load transfer scheme will be given including switches operation and theirs sequence. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the integrated GIS system with application programs using reactive Tabu search for distribution operation, an urban distribution system is selected for a case study.", "authors": [{"name": "Xian-Qi  Li", "ids": ["48570007"]}, {"name": "Zhi-Yuan  Zeng", "ids": ["1954249"]}, {"name": "Yong-Chuan  Zhang", "ids": ["2328089"]}, {"name": "Xue-Jun  Xu", "ids": ["50180858"]}], "inCitations": ["081e5afc01899194bb049760f32d806f8d3cc346", "cffea4089c35ed435ec82d6f90ff88fd826e714c", "8c50118f8ed34d9fec6a08fbd4e81b450ec25e4e", "fc1e3a18ff7ce918757406faaa2cca9fbf2f36e6", "754c30da5586c4633124a3eec656ff28daec8a10", "984b369e86f52ba30d59002dfa901a8959367936", "3fbc17c87992cdc1684ec89937bad9812f1225bf"], "outCitations": ["a5d04aaaab3e33f5f2c5b56611873c8d07189a64", "3427deae31442af573d9270a19c9fd9942e875cb", "cd8669df05c24fdcf4a34adacb1c84f6a8107b1d", "8071ec896e5e96ffc2bfcdbe0130162c67d6249f", "0ecfec2cda24e0447964d647b5a5040ba5835606", "f06957f88d80ae4b0d47f324a916f6c71e40af29", "7cf51cf237579ea288cf1812699d7bd3668a1443", "748a263a2008d7be0fe164250f7b9b2486d273d0", "e5a1438d63dfcece3d6235f3b654907c78a4540d", "64e92bfd42ad8212f4360f00489ff2cd39dd6691", "7d02f9de10868aeb854ed733d870659fabb91474", "e13c6120466380db9e68f4c1cd6b18a2902ec55d", "a67e1b37a89d357890ddaa07f9ad15abeb43cf75"], "year": 2007, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b954efee76bf3bf6adf0bea02d8637e00e79b148", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "3", "journalPages": "1428-1433", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370369", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370369", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2114817704", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

It is argued that this phase transition dooms every learning algorithm to fail to identify a target concept lying close to it. However, in this paper we exhibit a counter-example which shows that this conclusion must be qualified in the general case. Mostly building on the work of Winston on near-misse examples, we show that, on the same set of problems, a top-down data-driven strategy can cross any plateau if near-misses are supplied in the training set, whereas they do not change the plateau profile and do not guide a generate-and-test strategy.

Viewing software components as web services, the current solutions to web services composition based on business web services (using WSDL, BPEL, SOAP etc.) or semantic web services (using ontologies, goal-directed reasoning etc.) are both piecemeal and insufficient for building practical applications. Inspired by the work in Al planning on decoupling causal (planning) and resource reasoning (scheduling), we introduced the first integrated work in composing web services end to end from specification to deployment by synergistically combining the strengths of the current approaches. The solution is based on a novel two-staged composition approach that addresses the information modeling aspects of web services, provides support for contextual information while composing services, employs efficient decoupling of functional and non-functional requirements, and leads to improved scalability and failure handling. A prototype of the solution has been implemented in the Synthy service composition system and applied to a number of composition scenarios from the telecom domain.

In this paper, we described a three-subject experiment on commonsense knowledge acquisition from Chinese sentences extracted from a web corpus, aiming to investigate how people acquire commonsensical assertions from given sentences. We analyzed the experiment results from the perspectives of agreement test, concordance test, and divergence test. An important conclusion of our experiment is that sentences are different in their suitability, i.e. difficulty grade, for commonsense knowledge acquisition. And this difficulty grade also affects the number of commonsensical assertions acquired from a sentence, as well as the difference among the acquisition performances of different human subjects. We also discussed the problem of characterizing the difficulty grade by co-occurrence frequency of words and basic level category words.", "authors": [{"name": "Yao  Zhu", "ids": ["2211190"]}, {"name": "Liang-Jun  Zang", "ids": ["13162833"]}, {"name": "Dong-Sheng  Wang", "ids": ["46348954"]}, {"name": "Cun-Gen  Cao", "ids": ["145971573"]}], "inCitations": ["d763d95bf45c9a4ea51545d5447738f2d85d45fc", "7efc2392d76845cddf6bb70e6b73877165fd5bfa", "664046206c09121cd776b0641d7dd5df052bf49b", "f6aa79b7f345173876c22e64ed0a1f34fd277875", "fa75f94625b9ba7ca62185b55c9b3b50e3e8a9b7", "1750990a1033754b8cb89708c3b86dcf51352bad", "72f110c1b039733fe328043eab767b545c3194e8", "e013a62aeb439c05eba351b6502f0748a0bdcefc"], "outCitations": ["9e463eefadbcd336c69270a299666e4104d50159", "5e2653ae1c74992b9cfb87806d4153814760a87d", "2926b858f13ac3786228618ebf70788187f35231", "16b0058e31f8f0e7cc9e83acf2ff9654d7cf66c5", "83e1af089a19f1f4961641c088c4deb79ffd6073", "bb0968ab69b8655d442f17cdfe317ce3bfebd789", "50449f7d4810c79cc3f89a161df2244420a5b48f", "b1e7bf85c7caf1306fa27802218a8e2cdc8f4268", "026c94859c7159c38053a602c411c64e0d0305dd"], "year": 2008, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0ee3c52e253912003568a0bca1f47d87fb9cd9c2", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "3", "journalPages": "1564-1569", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620655", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620655", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2106626350", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Bimodal systems, employing both qualitative and quantitative representations of spatial information, are efficient and psychologically plausible means for spatial reasoning. Any such system must employ a translation from the qualitative level to the quantitative, where new objects (images) are created through the process of predicate projection. This translation has received little scrutiny. We examine this issue in the context of a bimodal spatial reasoning system integrated with a cognitive architecture (Soar). As part of this system, we define an expressive language for predicate projection that supports general and flexible image creation. We demonstrate this system on multiple spatial reasoning problems in the ORTS real-time strategy game environment.", "authors": [{"name": "Samuel  Wintermute", "ids": ["2123844"]}, {"name": "John E.
