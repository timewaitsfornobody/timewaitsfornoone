The performances of these seven kernels are compared in 30 UCI datasets. The experimental comparisons are carried out according to the following three aspects: the classification accuracy, ranking performance and the class probability estimation. The latter two are measured by the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the conditional log likelihood (CLL). The related kernels are compared via two-tailed t-test with a 95 percent confidence level and the Friedman's test using the 0.05 critical level. The experimental results show that the most commonly used Gaussian kernel can not achieve the best classification accuracy and AUC. However, on the CLL, the Gaussian kernel is statistically significantly better than the other six kernels.

The positional data is used to reserve the position information of items in the algorithm, By storing all the position information of the prefix sequences in advance, the verifying about the existence of extension of position with a prefix sequence can be easily implemented by scanning the position information of the prefix sequence, rather than scanning the pseudo-projected database repeatedly in the BI-Directional Extension closure checking scheme, which is the most consumed time phase in the algorithm of BIDE.

Effective selection of optimization options is a challenging task. Recent work has shown that machine learning can be used to select the best compiler optimization options for a given program. Machine learning techniques rely upon selecting features which represent a program in the best way. The quality of these features is critical to the performance of machine learning techniques. Previous work on feature selection for program representation is based on code size, mostly executed parts, parallelism and memory access patterns with-in a program. Spatial based information\u2013how instructions are distributed with-in a program\u2013has never been studied to generate features for the best compiler options selection using machine learning techniques. In this paper, we present a framework that address how to capture the spatial information with-in a program and transform it to features for machine learning techniques. An extensive experimentation is done using the SPEC2006 and MiBench benchmark applications. We compare our work with the IBM Milepost-gcc framework. The Milepost work gives a comprehensive set of features for using machine learning techniques for the best compiler options selection problem. Results show that the performance of machine learning techniques using spatial based features is better than the performance using the Milepost framework.

We represent visual words in two different views: the original features and the document co-occurrence representation. The latter view conveys semantic relations but is large, sparse and noisy. We use canonical correlation analysis between the two views to find a subspace in which the words are more semantically distributed. We apply k-means clustering in the computed space to find semantically meaningful clusters and use them as the semantic visual vocabulary. Incorporating the semantic visual vocabulary the features are quantized to form more discriminative histograms. Eventually the histograms are classified using an SVM classifier.

This gap has inspired web personalization and collaborative information seeking tools such as Google Alerts and has encouraged topic-specific blogs and podcasts. Web personalization tools lie on a spectrum between individualized and fully coordinated searches, between short and long term information interests and between public and private information needs. Much research attention has recently focused on web personalization (Castellano and Torsello 2009) (Smyth et al. 2009) (Chu and Park 2009) (Memari, Amer, and Gmez 2010) (Stamou and Ntoulas 2009) (Lacomme, Demazeau, and Camps 2010) (Amin and Nayak 2010). We aim to address yet unanswered questions in web personalization by providing an integrated view of documents found through different tools, considering user confidentiality, emphasizing the benefits of client-side web personalization, and highlighting the power of social webpage recommendation when traditional information retrieval and collaborative filtering methods are used in conjunction.

The strong independence assumption inherent in the bag-of-features representation is not realistic however: patches often overlap and share underlying image structures. Moreover, important information with respect to relative scales of the features is completely ignored, for the sake of scale invariance. Considering both spatial and scale-based constraints one can derive spatially constrained natural feature hierarchies within images. We explore the use of topic models that build such spatially constrained scale-induced hierarchies of the features in an unsupervised fashion.

Based on the review scores assigned by the individual reviewers to the submissions, program committees of conferences and journal editors decide which papers to accept for publication and which to reject. However, some reviewers may be more rigorous than others, they may be biased one way or the other, and they often have highly subjective preferences over the papers they review. Moreover, each reviewer usually has only a very local view, as he or she evaluates only a small fraction of the submissions. Despite all these shortcomings, the review scores obtained need to be aggregrated in order to globally rank all submissions and to make the acceptance/rejection decision. A common method is to simply take the average of each submission's review scores, possibly weighted by the reviewers' confidence levels. Unfortunately, the global ranking thus produced often suffers from a certain unfairness, as the reviewers' biases and limitations are not taken into account. \n \nWe propose a method for calibrating the scores of reviewers that are potentially biased and blindfolded by having only partial information. Our method uses a maximum likelihood estimator, which estimates both the bias of each individual reviewer and the unknown \"ideal\" score of each submission. This yields a quadratic program whose solution transforms the individual review scores into calibrated, globally comparable scores. We argue why our method results in a fairer and more reasonable global ranking than simply taking the average of scores. To show its usefulness, we test our method empirically using real-world data.", "authors": [{"name": "Magnus  Roos", "ids": ["38944088"]}, {"name": "J\u00f6rg  Rothe", "ids": ["145200357"]}, {"name": "Bj\u00f6rn  Scheuermann", "ids": ["1776439"]}], "inCitations": ["38ff6cf441050a1db10df85ac0771ccc88dea748", "e97c5b206c1f308b821917bc2f584b5f1faad547", "f7204a846e2937d5568b703f8fefbecad86f194c", "079482b992ce2da63f1d2bff655af178970d304b", "2cf3c50d49a646042dc299fc48982274139aeb20", "2b3ab7e9c66bffc7af9e4413036e7bba686a7734", "57ba110080b03ac74bba36c9808dd5762f16831f", "ed26e2868ec85149f5cca896b69f2488d22966a5", "784f0a3386bdbee7a60ac315371002bc21690844", "79fcecc4499082ab8f755fe6a3ff9ebee3d59ce8", "a3ca4893ae941bd1601322aface4840e47339761", "83165cf62e62a013c2bad61c98120ccb9a0087ae", "60e28cd1bee8a7eadf53e39505ef731d27086d3e", "06473d53c94c01fe393488327f085890c38bad6b", "3ae4849f6d05d8eb4ff3ed4301efe6b650667d45", "36d193c7a9523f55f9fe5ffd0730f248c241f5c7", "293ed3367027c99a81ead6ff3f31be7de43bce9c", "69a814fa0a69417927dcedd1836e01b3d77d0378", "d0a58b6da9f7788534aa9963a78c24a87038e4fc", "cc19de8d0782917098029ed20261cbe0b0c62bf5", "79ac86304dea22246d8b0a90c0dd2d2cd79361af", "01138945dc9de691cd559d09a46597cca7659efb", "78f1eef6d79a129f59b977a5037f5fc9cc7fda90", "149d59e53976d8b4f2a22b84aabe1f42cc1efd79", "f4906089f0720c83e57e4a46ae75283df4d67e5a", "ebb3ee44876393ccea7cf93cf1aa2c8267c7e04e", "f32c67daa6a93281bd8645fc2fa423dca67aea00", "df99459a75328393a9a989498db46ec445335724"], "outCitations": ["bc4b3860c50ec2fc05a89b56e8b7cd231afb6d7c", "0366bf320e446d90a8e34fa518a7c80d5749b39b", "45c445c077289ed12f5330f757431bf0d4501d14", "3fb66e141e6a09d1de9ba387d1570a240f8f450a", "43c3bfffdcd313c549b2045980855ea001d6f13b", "3e295f47e4a7e1db93953d4b277be4501a61886c", "ae907199ad52b6b5e38388950b5e05e8abb47a15", "e9cf6a7f1b437fc6d624276ff0e00ee822e4740f", "73c82f0630015c181d7ae6a7ff1d186dc26e29af", "d4b2aa0fa84087ea694cffc14c57ccab124cc153"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b3cc9cec4806700bd643eefbe0ab6fc891a6ba1c", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/download/3578/3850", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/view/3578"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "255-260", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2399506273", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

The L-GEM upper bound (R\u2217SM) is computed for each output neuron of a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN). For a multi-class classification problem, there are more than one output neurons. For a K-class problem, there will be K L-GEM values, i.e. one for each output neuron. How to use these K L-GEM values to select the architecture of a RBFNN is still an open problem. One could use average, maximum and minimum value among these K L-GEM values to estimate the overall performance of the RBFNN under investigation. All three of them are reasonable and provide some information about the generalization capability of the RBFNN.

This needs to be done in such a way that, if all that we know is the summary, as well as the votes of voters outside the subelectorate, we can conclude which of the m alternatives wins. This corresponds to the notion of compilation complexity, the minimum number of bits required to summarize the votes for a particular rule, which was introduced by Chevaleyre et al. [IJCAI-09]. We study three different types of compilation complexity. The first, studied by Chevaleyre et al., depends on the size of the subelectorate but not on the size of the complement (the voters outside the subelectorate). The second depends on the size of the complement but not on the size of the subelectorate. The third depends on both. \n \nWe first investigate the relations among the three types of compilation complexity. Then, we give upper and lower bounds on all three types of compilation complexity for the most prominent voting rules. We show that for l-approval (when l \u2264 m/2), Borda, and Bucklin, the bounds for all three types are asymptotically tight, up to a multiplicative constant; for l-approval (when l > m/2), plurality with runoff, all Condorcet consistent rules that are based on unweighted majority graphs (including Copeland and voting trees), and all Condorcet consistent rules that are based on the order of pairwise elections (including ranked pairs and maximin), the bounds for all three types are asymptotically tight up to a multiplicative constant when the sizes of the subelectorate and its complement are both larger than m1+\u220a for some \u220a > 0.", "authors": [{"name": "Lirong  Xia", "ids": ["35276487"]}, {"name": "Vincent  Conitzer", "ids": ["1749906"]}], "inCitations": ["0fd06a7324e6a6382ef285d0f2ef15910e0b9198", "fc34a5f317b4345c9c38f46c91a930c467b8d6f8", "86935624260f4c2cfa45d5a052a594ce36f4910d", "3d8d5af2f89293a0cf627b9d63ff4c9e146cb0d8", "455d2ba4c2112c4143c483639052aa453e6935ad", "5df6fd682e83f5d9893a63344bf7667d1a89eee0", "8fe2aaaef0fbd9f15e243e147c103648188a6265", "97611a1d6d7b750b28a88d3d18dec044af5244a8", "21c79fab676a980ed729d4423a494b601ae0ee60", "21b356086dba9464e40c2b8b6aa333e3cffa7283", "f712ffcf518392436efddec13f9f617b6e49e2d1", "536145435bf6841dd689e7c28e7d1954b0fe1ec5", "81227e622953ada4ae0131e8f500d01069ec9480", "ebe9e08c276210b5f61db33ba769a92938bcb37a", "91cc33c246c2bcc4bf74f806d06af548bcff8b93", "c7070880d247bb2157c076f3736adf25b18d3d55", "06473d53c94c01fe393488327f085890c38bad6b", "51e6c45aa1b097d92d220a7346bb86ecbcbcda50", "359ba00e7941acb54fcc199582f2f2b127a71bb9", "e89b7f1056d2cab8110ad524af4d43eaeab3400c", "f5fa2c0a2ab47cc36b2cddcee3af17d6fb9c68a9"], "outCitations": ["ebe9e08c276210b5f61db33ba769a92938bcb37a", "d1f78ffd886dbefc661d7f038fe7f6981f32f4de", "2972ad55099f656cbec1968c3e852796811b4cf1", "d69e1edc46e441e1500b00cb824938243857cf48", "7130e9ebdbccff73954fd737c6ff9056f95be63b", "5792509d0d3d15e0ef1e3373d1851ef1c1cd5e45", "e6a06773f9e9e04a402c3fe342dbc90aea7cf8ef", "f23b381facf1bed0bc0423bf7a9901ec4b5df529", "cd0140364338e49d57775ae04d4f6320760b6815", "69768dec9ad2c14327fc55080c7a02c2b136b6cc", "c09ebe73161e6e36014f4f17604664498ae3b0b6", "f0ee27482b0fe4e8883b95a67dc759be250e9c5a"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5cd6ea3622b95523b23a246f71d40b4ca876a7c5", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~lxia/Files/compilation_long.pdf", "https://users.cs.duke.edu/~conitzer/compilationAAAI10.pdf", "http://www.cs.duke.edu/~lxia/Files/compilation_long.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1789", "http://www.cs.duke.edu/~lxia/Files/compilation.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1789/2118", "http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~xial/Files/compilation_long.pdf", "http://cs.duke.edu/~conitzer/compilationAAAI10.pdf", "http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~xial/Files/compilation.pdf", "https://www.cs.duke.edu/~conitzer/compilationAAAI10.pdf", "http://www.cs.duke.edu/~conitzer/compilationAAAI10.pdf", "http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~lxia/Files/compilation.pdf", "http://cs.rpi.edu//~xial/Files/compilation_long.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "915-920", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "196507789", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Common analytical approaches to biped walk use simplified models of the physical reality. Such approaches are partially successful as they lead to failures of the robot walk in terms of unavoidable falls. Instead of further refining the analytical models, in this work we investigate the use of human corrective demonstrations, as we realize that a human can visually detect when the robot may be falling. We contribute a two-phase biped walk learning approach, which we experiment on the Aldebaran NAO humanoid robot. In the first phase, the robot walks following an analytical simplified walk algorithm, which is used as a black box, and we identify and save a walk cycle as joint motion commands. We then show how the robot can repeatedly and successfully play back the recorded motion cycle, even if in open-loop. In the second phase, we create a closed-loop walk by modifying the recorded walk cycle to respond to sensory data. The algorithm learns joint movement corrections to the open-loop walk based on the corrective feedback provided by a human, and on the sensory data, while walking autonomously. In our experimental results, we show that the learned closed-loop walking policy outperforms a hand-tuned closed-loop policy and the open-loop playback walk, in terms of the distance traveled by the robot without falling.", "authors": [{"name": "\u00c7etin  Meri\u00e7li", "ids": ["1704333"]}, {"name": "Manuela M.

In CSGs, the value of a coalition depends on the tasks its members can achieve. The tasks require various skills to complete them, and agents may have different skill sets. The optimal coalition structure is a partition of the agents to coalitions, that maximizes the sum of utilities obtained by the coalitions. We show that CSGs can represent any characteristic function, and consider optimal coalition structure generation in this representation. We provide hardness results, showing that in general CSGs, as well as in very restricted versions of them, computing the optimal coalition structure is hard. On the positive side, we show that the problem can be reformulated as constraint satisfaction on a hyper graph, and present an algorithm that finds the optimal coalition structure in polynomial time for instances with bounded tree-width and number of tasks.", "authors": [{"name": "Yoram  Bachrach", "ids": ["1698412"]}, {"name": "Reshef  Meir", "ids": ["39506910"]}, {"name": "Kyomin  Jung", "ids": ["1731707"]}, {"name": "Pushmeet  Kohli", "ids": ["143967473"]}], "inCitations": ["b853dff483ca8e46fad75646422932cfcd909e8f", "706c6bcac56ec49528207af920d40e91947e17c8", "4ee2c501a9131c4ae150c11eb19bd3e83f929c9b", "5fea0a08665508f08b7e57251f1f91b31d164c32", "771ba6fe5b9f0e8e86180ef3dd0e6b85ef174e0b", "3610d9654745054a07115fe53b7bf9aa0d1ddcba", "d083f70b081f2f47b0b050905bafc4c617b9dd0b", "bdfa7e334d8da86601647ebf205d7d9702001168", "7a6b347cccf7449c0330fedd212448c781e8a115", "d60d3a64a30dd3d4222f55aef247413f471a2dbf", "858d302788a6e4815928cccf137c95096f356bbb", "ee87bf0b37acd76313ce469aed1bc05540f2d184", "002febb80944d0433aeb07e426f011a7604ac690", "bddd010fc780c3648e52a759c0042130fd5eaa66", "06844194f78b2f6dfecaac37bb3da6dbd1e99d6e", "a4b9f6f39b15d689bc888ef965ac377849f3e11d", "0d03bac520026e476ff222a8985c68a2592efda0", "08e44ee898d61321ee50e8c370b5b5c067f67de3", "cbbb13ebad557dc1114fb0b02a9c706dd4a954fd", "21f59386251478d441b488a73ba3fc535c1bedf5", "8b8e42ea5272b3b89428e893ff0a681802af028f", "2b05fadd805d4380e5d2c5b2396cef11192624de", "eccf2dab6f78eea2e29a0dc51aaf73a0c222bf57", "d707bda69b78dca0321bc649ff4775479a452b62", "12f0f7642ddd39369c29eeba3646f813d103839b", "8758cb3012272dd53461f4fac4eea41e88dbc305", "4398971701ea362ec1bb8237164bd93df926c8e6", "06fb1e3c148bcb411ab358bd41d9720573dd8f64", "09c9cb0509b4b57d42e5cb617326d2c7eacdaf2e", "e4deaf034c6fc1fd893b0161e130f7fa066e52e3", "c99fe463454dfcba237ba66361050dfe9959df50", "f2ff13197dcdcbc83caa91d081b3cc86c305a002", "a174f8d605c4cffa3fa3ce34e58c8064ab41a0ef", "6c2cabe6ccc48b2209bf00830a5a8663bac65691", "7bd1d47819672dbbfd1d743274e0c261040d7389", "c940195cb051454eb01b14d88afaa90ee84e9166", "61c0e9c67efcec921800dea7d7bb8f8c1971f24d", "88da9e42af5ecf6c8d056a38991e5fac20776556", "ad62691bdf911a1b338a1cd1126665a5cedb07b6", "c1537bd81325431adac34c6882262e6a12576bad", "556023fcf6079996c754c56809dcd323388c95ae", "b24394360e48f7dabb72241f27e1b86d1491780f", "b9c3baffc9f6af8a4582d42881be10cdff3b9a03", "b9d030a25cca2a034ae73278a31a8ddcacc03186", "310d8c1a62bebb54941a11a60f683ad1ca4665af", "dd45cd77633fffd58d0640eaa9825ba86fa65ac4", "d83e787035425f1567f89a5cd4dd8e6045de9619", "babb3d025af26e378312c580ae24a9a1cbe158ee", "e8bf1c20fce536dfc5a81e812061480c7075a7ac", "ff20d184fff11f9e33ecb1b6fed87f16bccaf07f"], "outCitations": ["07a0a39ff4447ce9f0d2b06978d7b00a6d9fab15", "3524cdf7cf8344e7eb74886f71fcbb5c6732c337", "bdede1e17c947540b50e6e2db9e8467ddc6e7336", "42ae40a85a2b9e41197bacfdecd1576b02ab8827", "13001f25debd3b761185f57f71716463f000f025", "09faca699b6bbec9df816049f29fc2be5c975dfb", "09ffd0055db390dbb18a9b2a9fe6fce459a95f1e", "8fd82c4d8e6b980b2992a3b2b526e888b78a9413", "d3acd03af95e06bbcec5aeb8665a38465328381e", "d55aec97a2330e547b81924178aab5a4482feb94", "686f56d03abb20a0f34f44cbacdabd01fb24953e", "81111632eb35dadb1e9c00a2069b46e7565e2a43", "469ae62d3b34c007ead27cbe0fbc3ef1f8428a68", "c7a6510406f368fd696b93997db7df61c80ceb35", "216ec9333971cdaeddce7cafac70dbfe0cfa905d", "87b590d2c2e984062ff4c63dea2b3ea3a8d57061", "07418c73c3487dc22e604184f4773c6b8f0f4748", "dea8d6c9fdafe182208e14b3d36d0b30b6d6406b", "57236a1873e831e2442ec4cc2106c692c35432bb", "e49d241c34a06d79ac83a6d929d6afd05fce9c34", "504e0cd5758d94fea807ecdd1a9559dc9d92cc9b"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a8182734c8cdc5a4c7e0a698f96dae5a8776ba63", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bmjk_aaai2010.pdf", "http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/pkohli/papers/bmjk_aaai2010.pdf", "http://web.kaist.ac.kr/~kyomin/AAAI2010.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1760/2068", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1760", "http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/122222/cs-csg-camera.pdf", "http://research.microsoft.com/~pkohli/papers/bmjk_aaai2010.pdf", "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cs-csg-camera.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "703-708", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1545756310", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

This research investigated the format of mental representations of 3-D shapes during mental rotation. Specifically, we tested the extent to which visual information, such as color, is represented during mental rotation using methods ranging from reaction time studies, verbal protocol analysis, and eyetracking. Another set of studies examined whether people use piecemeal or holistic strategies to rotate complex objects. Results show that individuals with good rotation ability do not represent color during mental rotation and rotate whole shapes; whereas poor rotators do represent color and rotate individual pieces of the shape using piecemeal strategies. This work contributes to theories about cognitive shape processing by showing that different information processing strategies may be one cause of individual differences in mentally rotation performance.", "authors": [{"name": "Peter  Khooshabeh", "ids": ["2635945"]}, {"name": "Mary  Hegarty", "ids": ["145462959"]}], "inCitations": ["49820acb45e3d71c814cc45ca0f52fd7d484364a", "5c4806ea4e33329c5f71105835acffbc362531a5", "aefbf1480f8f20e4aec4496c3b29d08aef4023e1", "4e2c01618d12a94671d9a190342c4eff4e6dff33", "ff29a93aa3cd706598efc0d5e55ee247c5e74bcb", "326d279ccac22180af4fe9684cc9259d73736786", "c212fab497bafff1718acc8e0aad3e3748416350", "920895f9997a8fedacdbb1207a248312cc5b1acc", "d3f664c388f00b578691255d379f60e3ea043330", "8f21198ff177bd40cd7a853969a63f0635985e42", "fba96484c9265d2ce6792ae1f1ce938ecf0b9317", "689f7e345d0afb4bbe7fb8bfe59c065fb94d29de", "834491472526f640869aa345b4609a2d66d3ef99", "0809ef95495674d1450d78884e2fbe7eb14c9d52", "f1894c51fbdd817d775d4dd8c83b50d4f87913b9", "61010ded8d17181b9ca122ed12c3830dbe6b50b0", "cf4587b21a701ad6ce7167e266586db7436bc1fe", "3ca1b7844d1d00be1f73b6d2c102c7c5e949b641", "178f79c3aa25ea8760fa463c5882ffeb949555ca", "dff3a8b87505ec65737f2a26a967e83a9f12bbf3"], "outCitations": ["7e540d005b1c4670fb1ceba08a7a2d7393355cc7", "d8cc5e5c849203a74703a230c3488685a16dcfb1", "12b6d31ecb942f60a8428e1608b20fb583db0095", "dbed419873d211bb4a13c0a90c0fbaf83e601999", "65417b41be0c799c0984634fb9f8ed683951ec20", "3ca64ae2523a2023e72667c49e839468771b6a35", "10e2efc647a659c74e6a4368984f48d08b55aacc", "039d2b47a0cc38e222044892d2d11771e065cd61", "3faac0df2732e934a318e271972bad0d638b94f8", "5add6f4067e415a6dc76c025da3d49a6524a87c0", "d47441f680d0eef857b4be4a3679e5f7f91870ed", "6b2361b1c1a1c504ef093aed30719a31a51ef3b4", "e4f521b3a4c630e85b33550fce42a173b94dfc0b", "f1c0e09b9909a751de4f1c15cd4ad8d36b8c9e52", "07a525836aab4ee18708b2a029e95a9b83e1ec7e", "7abacd7c896f4ea185281ef7d2c708c65d02b1cb"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e429d8fc2a609b783fc141bf5ade2b5d02e0b807", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS10/paper/view/1166", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS10/paper/download/1166/1377", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS10/paper/viewFile/1166/1377"], "venue": "AAAI Spring Symposium: Cognitive Shape Processing", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1872510108", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Whole-body phase angle, measured by using a tetrapolar, phase-sensitive bioelectrical impedance analyzer, offers a new approach. Phase angle (arc tangent of the ratio of reactance to resistance) is a non-invasive measurement of tissue bioelectrical properties. Findings from observational studies reveal that phase angle is an independent indicator of prognosis in cancer because it illustrates cell membrane integrity and function that are not possible with other measurement approaches. We propose a phase angle-based biometric scoring system for prognosis in cancer. Phase angle measurements outside the range of normal values indicate categorical states (frailty and morbidity) with the severity based on magnitude and rate of diminution of the phase angle value compared to the early diagnosis value. Change in the rate of ascent, plateau and decline of the phase angle indicate impact of therapy throughout the clinical intervention and may provide significant additional prognostic information in support of improved decision making. Thus, phase angle immediately offers a safe, practical, economical, FDA-approved device and a unique biometric scoring system into the clinical practice of cancer treatment.", "authors": [{"name": "Henry C.

Through experiments involving human subjects, we show the P300 speller system that is optimized using the POMDP achieves a significant performance improvement in terms of the communication bandwidth in the interaction.", "authors": [{"name": "Jaeyoung  Park", "ids": ["1874079"]}, {"name": "Kee-Eung  Kim", "ids": ["1741330"]}, {"name": "Yoon-Kyu  Song", "ids": ["2752595"]}], "inCitations": ["5de7d557247655520d45e56ff00b8bb8353bc041", "6751ebabfddb19dd3ba2f6f41ad9126564b9bf2e", "50a6dd1d7e8dbddc42021dd996f52cb38436b8b5"], "outCitations": ["37ea96468874b78d021ef7a1ff5f4e8c433c5595", "025f218245698487ad0754ed23e09ab1cf76efde", "7f4617d950c45f698b4f3b055e061f6d65a2ec1a", "7e59e1adcdd8d2e6d2626bbf98e1b5e115e4b74d", "d25aa6ddf4e743f0eaa2a6811909b28527597c89", "198cff150157e9ac706b27e8fec61dc3f57daf5c", "d3daa7072cde8acac8e241756729823db4bf94ae", "6184aa6d99dd5c4d22135458b1478f4973944804", "116d7798c1123cf7fad4176e98f58fd49de4f8f1", "561dd7bbc62c5e4931dabfe4c09a33a9c0c241b3", "821229da85e5de4d4b7685398828847c6d671c5b", "268a4f8da15a42f3e0e71691f760ff5edbf9cec8"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/49cd0edaf879b6b9c11c412f61782c7328b817a3", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://ailab.kaist.ac.kr/papers/pdfs/PKS2011.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/view/3614", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/download/3614/4102"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1559-1562", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2216426007", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Then, the characteristic points in laser data and image data can be extracted to build a constraint equation to obtain the parameters of the pinhole camera model. Finally, the laser points can be projected onto the image with this model and displayed in the same image frame. Experimental tests on running vehicle showed that the system could avoid interference, ambiguity and display the driving environment including obstacles, vehicles, pedestrians and so on in real-time.

We also try to see how the performance of the metagenomic sample changes as the percentage of unknown sequences in the metagenomic sample is varied.", "authors": [{"name": "U  ManChon", "ids": ["34561017"]}, {"name": "Vasim  Mahamuda", "ids": ["2875814"]}, {"name": "Khaled  Rasheed", "ids": ["1799121"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["2c7377c7cea5e58569cefd6d0a0a8c79c00544e9", "dfe199440352079a9ebeb0851a2322c9ff0627dc", "9baa859020733a158d622f0b11ccfe0263131ca5", "ce16a2a1ad1e90cb5ed33600350c96d01e7ece34", "9b14a0ea5973d0de02911401215a76b780c1e2ef", "36bd438ed916f2aba8944e6b00ab57986974d3aa", "d921dadec0e089891652ab6fc2c7f0abbf2e4b70", "ab8b739139968ff5e531dcec7033c18668beffdf", "99ebe86ebc9364a0006e231ece73bdd6ff5f65c7", "0a99bfe2cd91c36e626032949a6d3c5fd50076f2", "bcee7c85d237b79491a773ef51e746bbbcf48e35", "5db7dc2239f820eae498b07a955f31b3d113179f", "b6e4f024da771be793178b754aeebe553a98a7f6"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/73241f176a448db367300432cda1a72bce67e2fe", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2010.123"], "venue": "2010 Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalName": "2010 Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "803-807", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2010.123", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2010.123", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2111236831", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Compared with normal inverted pendulum system, the angle bracket inverted pendulum has an inertia weight that caused by gravity downward along the ramp. The character of this system increases the difficulty of balancing the pole. In this paper, adaptive dynamic programming method is used for the system control. Two neural networks are designed separately to achieve the estimation of cost-to-go function and the output of control action through continuously learning. In the utility function design, the consideration of inertia influence is included which makes the estimation of system cost more exactly. In the output layer of the action network we use the S function as the transfer function that makes the outputs of control action be continuous variables. Furthermore, we increase a compensation part to decrease the influence caused by inertia factor.

In this paper we take arbitrary number of similar case distances as the input of the Choquet integral to flexibly represent the interaction among the cases. Consequently, our proposed approach has the ability to approximate the more general relation described by a CBR system. Because of the application of the Choquet integral and the fact that the existing CBR system can be regarded as a special case of our proposed approach, we largely generalize the application scope of traditional CBR techniques.

{"id": "cf6dd822627b7d46055d9f19893e627591eb550c", "title": "Optimal Social Trust Path Selection in Complex Social Networks", "text": "Online social networks are becoming increasingly popular and are being used as the means for a variety of rich activities. This demands the evaluation of the trustworthiness between two unknown participants along a certain social trust path between them in the social network. However, there are usually many social trust paths between participants. Thus, a challenging problem is finding which social trust path is the optimal one that can yield the most trustworthy evaluation result. In this paper, we first present a new complex social network structure and a new concept of Quality of Trust (QoT) to illustrate the ability to guarantee a certain level of trustworthiness in trust evaluation. We then model the optimal social trust path selection as a Multi-Constrained Optimal Path (MCOP) selection problem which is NP-Complete. For solving this problem, we propose an efficient approximation algorithm MONTE_K based on the Monte Carlo method. The results of our experiments conducted on a real dataset of social networks illustrate that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing approaches in both efficiency and the quality of selected social trust paths.", "authors": [{"name": "Guanfeng  Liu", "ids": ["8540458"]}, {"name": "Yan  Wang", "ids": ["35855941"]}, {"name": "Mehmet A.

This problem arises in a diversity of applications including diagnosis of dynamical systems and activity recognition. We provide a logical characterization of the notion of an explanation. To generate explanations we identify and exploit a correspondence between explanation generation and planning. The determination of good explanations requires additional domain-specific knowledge which we represent as preferences over explanations. The nature of explanations requires us to formulate preferences in a somewhat retrodictive fashion by utilizing Past Linear Temporal Logic. We propose methods for exploiting these somewhat unique preferences effectively within state-of-the-art planners and illustrate the feasibility of generating (preferred) explanations via planning.", "authors": [{"name": "Shirin  Sohrabi", "ids": ["1821852"]}, {"name": "Jorge A.

In this setting, the learning system is dealing with samples and labels provided by multiple teachers, who in common cases, are non-expert. Their labeling styles and behaviors are usually diverse, some of which are even detrimental to the learning system. Thus, simply putting them together and utilizing the algorithms designed for single-teacher scenario would be not only improper, but also damaging. The problem calls for more specific methods. Our work focuses on a case where the teachers are composed of good ones and irresponsible ones. By irresponsible, we mean the teacher who takes the labeling task not seriously and label the sample at random without inspecting the sample itself. This behavior is quite common when the task is not attractive enough and the teacher just wants to finish it as soon as possible. Sometimes, the irresponsible teachers could take a considerable part among all the teachers. If we do not take out their effects, our learning system would be ruined with no doubt. In this paper, we propose a method for picking out the good teachers with promising experimental results. It works even when the irresponsible teachers are dominating in numbers.", "authors": [{"name": "Shuo  Chen", "ids": ["47335768"]}, {"name": "Jianwen  Zhang", "ids": ["49050561"]}, {"name": "Guangyun  Chen", "ids": ["2571142"]}, {"name": "Changshui  Zhang", "ids": ["1700883"]}], "inCitations": ["ab6aaebf2246f30eb69fb5cf11cc2c5b663b9970", "1f19563ef60bf034529f12dd6ec0ce4ae12a416b", "4de9cf632b3baa46af78693c9831a4c1b7618738", "59113590a1b60bef2bd15621d01eb188d775ab4a", "83eba5385b5eabbf67047af3e78157170ca0f4f8", "d360ad80158a86536fcef3baf0ebb95cdd30c439", "e2d1c2cb15e1f6090c557ecf29b7082c245da4f9", "2c61ba60ea1296bf641ccc48974461b085a42a89", "5b314d45ab024da7b5addf74c64bd57dc6a4b993", "94d058860ed6b8a1d1cbb77363b9c709c6926467", "417974cfb044b93d2ad57b198dbbd39abce7cc17", "bad6fd3ec884608980ac2dd6ca2aa588ccbafb15", "7b396a8b31542ea482f5b4644c0343ca1caa432d", "cb062c3af24bb104697d3018796acb3ee383a40f"], "outCitations": ["0165568bcc1a819c18564567f2ec15d859be2519", "5b49178c0638d026ae49d9d1b89cee4575d6833d", "eda90bd43f4256986688e525b45b833a3addab97", "1ad15c08556c8f8e3739703857ea01077ce738c5", "42fe803abcfe68b4d44646b234272d5653dd08f4", "ba6afa50bda0da7945306b147a3b795e2e9c7afc", "d1ee87290fa827f1217b8fa2bccb3485da1a300e", "d2c733e34d48784a37d717fe43d9e93277a8c53e", "4759b9e47a2139a860402512427d45b15f69e1c5", "d513d8b6470c7cbbeca8563505de8711325a3179", "78053512af13466c569e5946acfc3953bbfc9d36", "8d45c1f950aead98d30ed9fe6612b8418c3cd173", "a3f853572e12b51c4c227590168c95b7cd0ca666", "5ee8a371fc5adc5469435020a52fb815f3b57a71", "33d65cb3e2e852a5618e9432c2d067f47ab09832", "65a69968bb8c41aad0113cec4c2d981bddf50bc8"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bf12a60fd1000a48254db226a79c858ef9b525f7", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1605/2010", "http://www.shivani-agarwal.net/Teaching/E0371/Papers/aaai10-irresponsible-teachers-dominating.pdf", "http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~shuochen/pubs/aaai10_chen.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1605/2010", "http://drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~shivani/Teaching/E0371/Papers/aaai10-irresponsible-teachers-dominating.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI 2010", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "419-424", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2467426667", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

International utility, transportation, and information networks facilitate the efficient flow of information, energy, goods and people. These networks exhibit a scale-free network structure with a few large \u201chubs\u201d. Yet their efficiency belies their lack of robustness. Because such networks transcend national boundaries, furthermore, disruptions to the network in one geographic region may have profound economic and national security costs for countries in another region. To illustrate how complex networks may transmit costs among countries, this paper builds an agent-based model (ABM) of the international air transportation system. The ABM employs a genetic algorithm to identify \u201csmall\u201d disruptions that produce cascading network failures. The study makes two contributions. First, it demonstrates how some complex networks evolve into network structures that trade off robustness for efficiency. Second, it illustrates how researchers can combine agent-based modeling, evolutionary computation, and network analysis to simulate differing failure modes for global networks. This convergence of simulation methodologies characterizes the emerging field of computational social science.", "authors": [{"name": "David C.

In this paper, we present the architecture and cost-efficient implementation of an autonomous digital product memory that generates and interprets its diary using rule-based reasoning methods. As we assume an open, heterogeneous sensor infrastructure, we rely on standard syntax and semantics provided by the Web Ontology Language OWL. The digital product memory collects and provides data using the OWL fragment OWL 2 RL which can be processed with standard rule engines. As rule engine we use CLIPS on embedded hardware and exemplify the application of the digital product memory e. g. for predictive maintenance.", "authors": [{"name": "Christian  Seitz", "ids": ["145529030"]}, {"name": "Steffen  Lamparter", "ids": ["1748185"]}, {"name": "Thorsten  Schoeler", "ids": ["40566051"]}, {"name": "Michael  Pirker", "ids": ["2129836"]}], "inCitations": ["b9f6190c73e2654c3f3b77f74d8b77d2ce969b84", "9bccac594922160f8a8c27741e62f9bd814db264", "e6c1058217b3b9e7d73a7b3a146b4110b00ca766", "4c7f5be0b605556db5ef41df032225632fd76439", "0e23720af066f446d61611377de0506f658bbef7", "aa65a76bb5d76b696c7e097b7c4adfc65e694b75"], "outCitations": ["3eb6c6660a757b41dbe1258e8994540b291b7856", "25954f66c1d74c6945a8ba4837516328132651d7", "b658eeec31066cd764eb3a4fd2a9de956fb87dad", "25d9733d0a28ecd342e7ebfaadbf22dab475ca06", "17d41e6fd35629a9cc14f203b0035985f44500d5", "3f716790b71b0702c11dd31411725540e8b3fb23", "4c988c690791bf445b9f74c402692ebc1fea5f2a", "94b6c5ffabad4a024ae8ae1dbe3873a99375bf43", "d507279bcc3ee86c1a22430e96bf52071c48c6b0", "6d4d67513ce3a6b153dc4b5e41657f7984694ce9", "d118b74ed2083467746848525b29772adb49795c", "de3b00f44b0bd830254747790326d7288342fcaa", "464eb245ff9822defa8db82c385ff1fd0b0b6ffe", "90de62bcc5504b89e97260c1f38d46cdbca309ae", "012691193bd3142b587cc4222ac5604a168a1891", "0e7246e5b76a749563086b80c76d025b4254e0da", "7a195957eca847e32b82d4dabc8d7447a4d80ac8", "b2c6b1bb22559ca2548505733a7aaabbc38342c4", "a361700a350f928b9d3a5730acff25c2722e3a60", "3953ee5d9d6d0568839b54d4a5526a1b422e6e10", "4f35424f9dd22f26157786016d819f160a5fcb55"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a821f40d86b75c3cdeadf582f9d10d18fc6ef7b2", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS10/paper/viewFile/1118/1417", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS10/paper/download/1118/1417", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS10/paper/view/1118"], "venue": "AAAI Spring Symposium: Embedded Reasoning", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2171827411", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a methodology for quantifying multiple environmental impacts of a product, across its entire life cycle \u2013 from creation to use to discard. The key object of interest in LCA is the inventory tree, with the desired product as the root node and the materials and processes used across its life cycle as the children. The total impact of the parent in any environmental category is a linear combination of the impacts of the children in that category. LCA has generally been used in 'forward' mode: given an inventory tree and impact factors of its children, the task is to compute the impact factors of the root, i.e., the product being modeled. We propose a data mining approach to solve the inverse problem, where the task is to infer inventory trees from a database of environmental factors. This is an important problem with applications in not just understanding what parts and processes constitute a product but also in designing and developing more sustainable alternatives. Our solution methodology is one of feature selection but set in the context of a non-negative least squares problem. It organizes numerous non-negative least squares fits over the impact factor database into a set of pairwise membership relations which are then summarized into candidate trees in turn yielding a consensus tree. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach over real LCA datasets obtained from a large computer manufacturer.", "authors": [{"name": "Naren  Sundaravaradan", "ids": ["2847441"]}, {"name": "Debprakash  Patnaik", "ids": ["2681048"]}, {"name": "Naren  Ramakrishnan", "ids": ["1755938"]}, {"name": "Manish  Marwah", "ids": ["2733065"]}, {"name": "Amip  Shah", "ids": ["1954017"]}], "inCitations": ["47946a4c09e01abc917d0f207e96700e3770ae97", "82b5b2025fcd46b4ea9c26862801aa80a8d0dfde", "bd47c8c1bac8dc43a38f8589c0ba0198b2fbea29", "f68246973e874c291ac80e5e617ad596f09e7038", "a207049d163bb9bac21437e7097f97fb16f06d54", "8a3d8f1629a78598e4fd466cda32babe1ca77050", "62e7b1ff5a924bac3011bdcf65b4413134d41c0f", "e990639bba861a7a89180cdea3d6e9ec32735583", "8bcc25651b62532f639fe713da9d7b67c742d562", "ffeb738231a41ab2cabeaf1cfe2c4b35b0224b81"], "outCitations": ["9996e26b6b642d12ac1206ad7975ff127b3014ec", "ba969a4f3bc5f5a84f6025478e566c40661d85f3", "5d09e4a4a884a3e2ef52c7411e13970ac91a63c5", "d0be1e20643e7e15bd4669f1c3ef0c2287852566", "318a3c9eb7e55b7e75915be68b2d8aa4d405b50a", "5ed4e1dbe10c0ac9fa00b30d1882cae1249a5a6a", "b35e036e0226d923d03c06ae393084b40c9dec7e", "c4bc033e630f616dc2a38e1ec2d6e2882ad11372", "fdbc6185971f9c784a60b7f7c1fca3bcd776727f", "97dcab33aa0f1b8c98eec95e52e13596f3fb890d"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/16ba522057811c5c02ef8809df8f1de662411c76", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.cs.vt.edu/~ramakris/papers/aaai11-narens.pdf", "http://www.hpl.hp.com/people/manish_marwah/aaai2011.pdf", "http://people.cs.vt.edu/naren/papers/aaai11-narens.pdf", "http://people.cs.vt.edu/~naren/papers/aaai11-narens.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/view/3751", "http://people.cs.vt.edu/~ramakris/papers/aaai11-narens.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/download/3751/4089"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1415-1420", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2189224032", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

We define a pattern to be an identified set of values of sampled, quantized factor data which occurs before at least two instances of an EoI and only before the occurrences of EoIs. Not all EoIs instances exhibit the same patterns preceding their occurrence, but we hypothesize that there exist sets of patterns which, taken together, precede all EoIs of the same type. A set of patterns which taken together precede all EoIs of the same type are called a \u201ccover\u201d.

Biochemical networks are often represented as directed graphs in which vertices represent chemical compounds and edges represent chemical reactions between compounds. Therefore, a biochemical longest feedback loop can be formulated as the longest cycle in a directed graph. Because finding the longest cycle in a directed graph is NP-hard, in this paper, we proposed an intelligent heuristic algorithm to find the longest cycle in a directed graph. We tested the algorithm on both randomly generated complex networks and real biochemical networks extracted from the KEGG database. The results showed that our algorithm is able to find more than 70% of the real longest cycles in the 200 randomly generated complex networks and also can find the feedback loop in the longest pathway. Compared with the traditional breadth first search pathway finding algorithm, the search efficiency of the proposed algorithm has been improved dramatically. Among the feedbacks found from the KEGG database using the proposed algorithm, the longest feedback includes 8 compounds, 9 reactions, and 6 pathways across different modules.", "authors": [{"name": "Chunmei  Liu", "ids": ["35106248"]}, {"name": "Hui  Li", "ids": ["40012524"]}, {"name": "Alison  Leonce", "ids": ["3233249"]}, {"name": "Legand L.

A PC-based platform with distributed human-machine interface is applied to supervise the pen-tilt motions and simulate the scenario of the robot head using a modulized infrared CCD.

This paper describes a type independent search and candidate generation paradigm for QA that leverages Wikipedia characteristics. This approach is particularly useful for adapting QA systems to domains where reliable answer type identification and type-based answer extraction are not available. We present a three-pronged search approach motivated by relations an answer-justifying title-oriented document may have with the question/answer pair. We further show how Wikipedia metadata such as anchor texts and redirects can be utilized to effectively extract candidate answers from search results without a type ontology. Our experimental results show that our strategies obtained high binary recall in both search and candidate generation on TREC questions, a domain that has mature answer type extraction technology, as well as on Jeopardy! questions, a domain without such technology. Our high-recall search and candidate generation approach has also led to high overall QA performance in Watson, our end-to-end system.", "authors": [{"name": "Jennifer  Chu-Carroll", "ids": ["1403252641"]}, {"name": "James  Fan", "ids": ["32653281"]}], "inCitations": ["d1c5ed40ce8926926d450404498caf5144e47186", "95e0ab9d3168dab15a63393776264148c2e950ba", "99a821e80f3e9231f9cf5879f9f0eaa7fdcde5ac", "2da1c27bef3b78be0d020932fe98e0a5d02bae82", "1b07873241c8f655085015408b94bc51932317f0", "a494a3de88348dd7e246ee3e7ad9f22907aa642b", "db67c466bf93e9413419782590d66b6942748a3b", "6131a27718f97a310e43df6a950284d3a793f5f9", "21e32807197829b9a04d0b06686ec9292b3f6572", "76b25a52dea6110b65d075b04d6f940f40f06414", "a3d499ed005fc487f4267c74047e4937eaf9a424", "1436021c4aa96a01a08d1e946abb61a2337ac2db", "8f556f8c4a954376add749ec127ba716bbcc15d3", "9c37eba4156e01b588008228b8dbc3429577ef52", "a39ee4d6b62a255b57e32be87bb2068f0bd27dac", "65fa69d60e353ef0dc815f18feeee4227e8c2cdb", "5305d206708a497446c71d73dfd426e3904f3d38", "395674ccb69dbefd899d05a3b2f6fb318f46b0d1", "ed400ad3acdd21693284a136c100a078b4a40d23"], "outCitations": ["f719fb22397e46df7d20f45c16ec9c68919d785c", "ba634828840e6a586eb269a47b3517cf557ad61d", "3e48cb9b4838f8947388c3926df70211ca49b51a", "7c56100bd4b89735bf9332b79c12e54d9368e9ac", "07bc30a5ba6f557aa45df3b5b0cbf4fc023de892", "a172a5c7856f27588ac45c1df6d1463a0c4eb3b5", "65a51ae723b9bf9983bf78090abceeb09bb0d6f5", "6ac274fb90f64c41de2bc5b0935dc57bf14a60a6", "122ab8ab9a7661748ff8719c5f90df6ab279f738", "9d0616073ac858d53474a696455b3ffcf86ea208", "a0e2b1bd609a7ccbfe3bc1d2b304cf0ca4a7c930", "824a847a00f146e1f8b4d0d2115e885248288cdc", "a9fee459ed211f53bfadef22e3ab774d0e927358", "e8803791c8a90926445eac8f86c95e60bf8d38c0", "e61cb59270748e19be7d359d787361e6f6750e10", "feabe3a669c73eebf5a175f1e6d7f4dab4b6af88", "ad6e10463f41b47ff132051e778017b26a8d3964", "ed5fe38e1a11195e3555dc36618d32517b9dca7c", "def713a8e7af6f86881b8dad541885c7b074644b", "da7d8f3d6f6e09d2be7235bd167909291ae053ac", "3ff2862a8121cc823a8eb72f3e0a97bbf25c82ec", "beb3043fce78576b3d3a0d4cdb322725021fe338"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c9a1ea5783f084dae8e092e0cae3c7ff691e3fa4", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/view/3544", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/download/3544/3970"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "872-877", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "162616406", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are applied on data analysis, artificial intelligence, and decision making widely. Until now, if we want to find the optimization of a fuzzy equality, usually we have to defuzzify the operation result of the fuzzy equation. Therefore, we have to find a nice defuzzifing method. Here we use the graded mean integration representation method for representing a generalized trapezoidal fuzzy number. We also have proved some representing properties of generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers after the fuzzy arithmetical operations with Second Function Principle. The results show that this representation method is better than other methods. Moreover, we use this representation value to define the ranking, distance, similarity absolute value, and fuzzy distance as a excellence ideas.", "authors": [{"name": "Shan-Huo  Chen", "ids": ["2290035"]}, {"name": "Chien-Chung  Wang", "ids": ["9282053"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["8b8f1f0bbe29362f808562f5bb425dc166d90d6c", "e016a8e367ff4a6aedf5f18c3e46fba2859356b4", "a0e88b2b6c9c973bb92436cc4b458490649b0a8a", "ebe093b1ce83cf8f79bac13a90aa35d87ce3aca4", "55c399a2e65a73dd5797ee3a8570f072caa41a05", "f78a9120f11189e2edddcec5f97c6d78e3e94d7a"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/02034c82760e6f1bc0e84b3d71cbc8bb15158378", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016699"], "venue": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "1", "journalPages": "262-266", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016699", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016699", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "magId": "2128053805", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

To this end, we first define a set of generic mood descriptors. Secondly, we make up several user profiles according to the age and gender. We then obtain musical items, for each group, to separately train the statistical models. Using the two different user models, we verify our hypothesis that the user profiles play an important role in mood perception by showing that both models achieve higher classification accuracy when the test data and the mood model are of the same kind. Applying our system to automatic play list generation, we also demonstrate that considering the difference between the user groups in mood perception has a significant effect in computing music similarity.", "authors": [{"name": "Kyogu  Lee", "ids": ["34674393"]}, {"name": "Minsu  Cho", "ids": ["72643925"]}], "inCitations": ["2e49fb0671d5792d555e0d862f7065eca6c20c1e", "618062f2ecc452c7147c36d4dfabc43088a4ead4", "2c469092b8f31ca5d68102e906cdb8c14349e264"], "outCitations": ["0d1acfaf5fb012dca2e4934424a0d8c590fce93d", "d66bfccd21821dfc18184395405a723bfba0dd7d", "e41ba5dc12c79a64dfa905c0328f95976252ffe0", "84fb680cd25546623de1eb4dd1db072b5c81747a", "9b17b16b6852d5c47433746c2efb4909abcd6639", "065707f54ea2db084056f6a3f118362bef2cb39e", "f74bd60b0e36df13d62cb5a3b9dfc43fc5f70206", "3286d06837a22ecd3413dfccd1832f548a7a09ef", "b697be997d2db809b75446fe9e817cb49f8d94e5", "3232058b0f79080a4b047897efbc96cfd40bf89e", "66f643d5cccdef27ba3e22cff23dac814abba006", "b8d4e264a040ea6b2fbeabc51028f55cee0170de", "3ff9db300014d7703df043d2d5b2dcfd118b058d"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1b3d0c0eb4597bc0614a1c784750759403f067bd", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2011.96"], "venue": "2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops", "journalName": "2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops", "journalVolume": "2", "journalPages": "130-135", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2011.96", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2011.96", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2543618435", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

We first decompose the challenging problem of pair-wise constraint propagation into a series of two-class label propagation subproblems and then deal with these subproblems by quadratic optimization with symmetric graph regularization. More importantly, we clearly show that pairwise constraint propagation is actually equivalent to solving a Lyapunov matrix equation, which is widely used in Control Theory as a standard continuous-time equation. Different from most previous constraint propagation methods that suffer from severe limitations, our method can directly be applied to multi-class problem and also can effectively exploit both must-link and cannot-link constraints. The propagated constraints are further used to adjust the similarity between data points so that they can be incorporated into subsequent clustering. The proposed method has been tested in clustering tasks on six real-life data sets and then shown to achieve significant improvements with respect to the state of the arts.", "authors": [{"name": "Zhenyong  Fu", "ids": ["37876634"]}, {"name": "Zhiwu  Lu", "ids": ["1776220"]}, {"name": "Horace Ho-Shing Ip", "ids": ["1687108"]}, {"name": "Yuxin  Peng", "ids": ["143753918"]}, {"name": "Hongtao  Lu", "ids": ["37514286"]}], "inCitations": ["d7da0f595d135474cc2193d382b22458b313cdbf", "ddc51956ea448511db53a638039656c200a4ba10", "b2eda87fa8b68ffd71b89af0b28a1d529abccbc0", "cb0dda31c5b1c389516f5c2514d999de21af6730", "d256ef7ed2bb2c1d7d0355b5c1cc0945c2daf93d", "76f922d12634a9f0fa82295bb944f51aeda0e9fe", "e0cae64816a9525eaeeeb5be6dfd1e74d1a1ba91", "0b963f342ea206951495098b72362076587207ca", "964eb383c1def6d1139e80d98d12d788c700734c", "ce0c0ad08b356ced2fa498b46a3ef00b39c952a7", "ab6dda78bb6a204d526e15b2466ffca346936945", "ed5331c59352287ede4464ba482af376821f9c9b", "52e889bc81c8129985ebf3d1a4f3cfdca0322abb", "321977c87de2e4c72b44f3181a76a7a58b03cf7b", "a9057dcc2ac4136defde10d4dab94b364a88b256", "33199b3221ee6c7f30cc50a4966c2ac84b725cf6", "cfa9e983010dc2b21064cf0e5dcc199404c778b3"], "outCitations": ["95d6ff6279fa0f92df6fae0e6bd4c259acfc8f09", "eda90bd43f4256986688e525b45b833a3addab97", "b53eed317e3bdfec5a1bdc8b0f643de34c21b315", "63be40918452ff21c51006e8207f5b11eb21b887", "869171b2f56cfeaa9b81b2626cb4956fea590a57", "3215cbbf6c328b0a59058816fbfe51424febb156", "af13e138bd9ee6083b8e00e857abb2f4911eb51b", "8365cd5d9b5329475ae2f8fabb91952bc4967ae3", "3d94018eee6dc0a0f5acfa092d5641eb65227a07", "d1a2d203733208deda7427c8e20318334193d9d7", "b94c7ff9532ab26c3aedbee3988ec4c7a237c173", "2ff6fcebe5561433a2d2abeb8b30b2fbf3c0e303", "27eb7cb878f8db79a5a985ae08d7a4ae95b0d409", "46770a8e7e2af28f5253e5961f709be74e34c1f6", "01d5bf24c0b35d9a234d534bf69924fa16201dee", "a640f027bb2b2fb1e4d8562ce8b508767bdc9cbd", "15d2aa6511bd0a8de5cb690bf406d90eef902ff1", "b756db6dd3928f985275bf77a36f4e6e2d8f4cfd", "e22aa74185f6557e5ebc9d118ee559e23856f9a1", "9d4d9e6166be21295465dc118373707442ab2391"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/434865ee504d1f54ea4c008374f5e356f17968a2", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/download/3458/3879", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3458/3879", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/view/3458"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "350-355", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "3583549", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

A well known algorithm based on boosting is AdaBoost. Boosting At Start (BAS) is a boosting framework that generalizes AdaBoost by allowing any initial weight distribution. BAS Committee is a scheme that uses feature clustering to determine the best weight assignments in the BAS framework. One of the drawbacks of BAS Committee is its final step which uses a simple Majority Voting approach over the chosen classifiers. Entropy Guided Transformation Learning (ETL) is a machine learning strategy that combines Decision Trees and Transformation Based Learning avoiding the explicit need of Template Design. Here, we present ETL Voting BAS Committee, a scheme that combines ETL and BAS Committee in order to determine the best combination for the classifiers of the ensemble. Besides that, since no extra assumption is made, ETL Voting is generic and can be used in any committee approach. Our empirical findings indicate that the BAS performance can be improved with a new combination of the classifiers determined by ETL Voting.", "authors": [{"name": "Ruy Luiz Milidiu", "ids": ["8756311"]}, {"name": "Julio Cesar Duarte", "ids": ["145071703"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["ea8f1c73422b087738827a665b2aaf9b93d5c543", "be75dcfa4d2ffe06bb8609a3c0ff1c50b07d9c0e", "dfe543a2f0a4d54338367c8d45544e54fdfaf2c9", "b6cf9167aeb2782651156de5e22cad82ee69a225", "d9c71db75046473f0e3d3229950d7c84c09afd5e", "cdf113ac623610c39897655195ce6d11e1269af9", "26ae952599aa9ba5815a80356024258247fc2b10", "046b7f6b48e4d9fcf173dea0a0802d7e87b383e1", "62af35038b5d3080cf84f4e28e8fd6f3ee05a133"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/746d7274b2ca299717495fbe72940dfeb103a8fb", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "1", "journalPages": "61-66", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212540", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212540", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2091819643", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Though there exist a lot of approaches to classify the uncertain data by hard classifiers, few of them address the classification of the uncertain data by soft classifier. In this paper, we propose an automatic soft classifier to classify the uncertain data. The automatic soft classifier first combines Fuzzy C-means with a fuzzy distance function to assign the uncertain data into their corresponding clusters. Then, the clusters are split automatically and incrementally based on an objective function until the value of the objective function reaches the threshold given by the user. The experiments show that automatic soft classifier works well in a database with uncertainties.", "authors": [{"name": "Le  Li", "ids": ["50704113"]}, {"name": "Zhiwen  Yu", "ids": ["144861834"]}, {"name": "Zijian  Feng", "ids": ["2253414"]}, {"name": "Xiaohang  Zhang", "ids": ["2285128"]}], "inCitations": ["2a6251deec9dfb91bdd9d7a2494db5f84e4636af", "f508052825691a5446ff581a3d12249ff3e45460", "a198eea0d81e223e49724471f4bcb9f59fc38d9e", "b6775632bbfd885c66f30a3fdbaacf0381e5a89c", "4fabe7b108f0abbf489c1d20dc2e0019ef6fccff", "15be11ae5473531a9f41927fd6c23aeac2fb7dda"], "outCitations": ["a21237c60c07bda44dbb20ede6ee6746461834fa", "e0cca9a1f4408f1245c1c48bdec7550ec6ec7e7a", "f142a5eb12ea07c0222dcf88c1bf10e35137d606", "5c8fe9a0412a078e30eb7e5eeb0068655b673e86", "9bcfb84088035fb6191e42c924eab9c1a4f9844a", "8b93308cf0eb439a0deabd318d7e7cb3668d6830", "09669b6b0eb122ae96872400832b7d470c3eb375", "91122f049af8d923398f732c3f4340fcb1ae76cf", "b6d9d6c25f5b7a3689c503e7df74e937ebd5cdb8", "79594e5f158328944421a562525aad4816fb0c9f", "450d66c79441de4ce9788d9f7cace4e96993748b", "55d0b6a8db49630d6b26d2959701745585567717", "98ed6603a337f1bdb0671f671207dcb15345eb2e", "fc4e556c6711d0a3fe5a01419e26f68a32bf985c", "c1a101713bba9babc0a4529b30cd2c63c76d42dc", "8023ebec4b1cb98e8357a0fc3d84bd8ba6631898", "4ac1a5d1a4a74cf6c48b02f127f2eab8c12ee8b4"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9105b7c57b546f05a440502590eb078dd8a4f182", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016789"], "venue": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "2", "journalPages": "679-684", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016789", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016789", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2089888818", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

The biogenesis of a functional miRNA is largely dependent on the secondary structure of the miRNA precursor (pre-miRNA). Recently, it has been shown that miRNAs are present in the genome as the form of polycistronic transcriptional units in plants and animals. It will be important to design methods to predict such structures for miRNA discovery and its applications in gene silencing. In this paper, we propose a parallel algorithm based on the master-slave architecture to predict the secondary structure from an input sequence. First, the master processor partitions the input sequence into subsequences and distributes them to the slave processors. The slave processors will then predict the secondary structure based on their individual task. Afterward, the slave processors will return their results to the master processor. Finally, the master processor will merge the partial structures from the slave processors into a whole candidate secondary structure. The optimal structure is obtained by sorting the candidate structures according to their scores. Our experimental results indicate that the actual speed-ups match the trend of theoretic values.", "authors": [{"name": "Dianwei  Han", "ids": ["1741631"]}, {"name": "Guiliang  Tang", "ids": ["144410623"]}, {"name": "Jun  Zhang", "ids": ["33872841"]}], "inCitations": ["ddae05ca459ff5aa7fc8ed66b16ca5916d782cd2"], "outCitations": ["13839fffee4be2726740a929847538eb21809e87", "48bc3d3bf2c6869332e34a3ed350880ae1028af4", "fe724c5ccf7f49a38fd54970bb8eb15e032814c9", "f1852e23a96bb49800543d686d97f64df07d5d2b", "4cc29c9fe3c2d0381649465a7be3ab0a662fbcc4", "d5b78078c432369f8ff4de5b3e6eafdc08d7a173", "0442c89a09bfd5ba7f09340d0b23143f6c3f32b7", "3f3757499affd63e5eb65f49541f38043275a047", "ab4ecab99dc9fbeecc006dfa0aa99787771d3dbd", "29957a1002549333f8c797df619d4b327df7cac7", "b686010b6e0ce0f76c1e8703a0f698a977bfe808", "d453eccafa470e6b3dbe53c054a914605eb023a2", "ad8c667d17412887fe9824c3b9cdfc4c76abc3e4", "293db2444be521654a6b031569abb553181bfd57", "1435c68bef30424e9f5e657abc3948a3ef2cf903", "b2a42270c4c1afd1e972acde361f29313e6c30f6", "d9ab41bdba5b050af50015231bd3dbc71b59916c", "698684c32e2aa3fd7ed8c11f03a6878241a91ff4", "e1df2d444a11dd23e9279e706b84c7ab3e576357", "83cedf5947fb0f9c791280c050aa9e9fdd8935bc", "f44e4fe385aefeb1e655253853f04f89d5acfec4", "702ab599fe59103294eccc8a2967c674426843c0", "9573f3023d89478399bd1f0688795bd7bd8ae561", "ca057813519e7c4ddf698e4e4be78cf3390fc5b3", "c9c30c57b4df1098aedd7d5b6dbfcb4a67c37191"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4fec7fe5ca1e24f5a2f99df1dc23ec0d2229f931", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2010.80"], "venue": "2010 Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalName": "2010 Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "509-514", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2010.80", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2010.80", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2128562237", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

These methods assume that the tasks share the same kernel, which could limit their applications because in practice different tasks may need different kernels. The main challenge of introducing multiple kernels into multiple tasks is that models from different Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs) are not comparable, making it difficult to exploit relations among tasks. This paper addresses the challenge by formalizing the problem in the Square Integrable Space (SIS). Specially, it proposes a kernel based method which makes use of a regularization term defined in the SIS to represent task relations. We prove a new representer theorem for the proposed approach in SIS. We further derive a practical method for solving the learning problem and conduct consistency analysis of the method. We discuss the relations between our method and an existing method. We also give an SVM based implementation of our method for multi-label classification. Experiments on two real-world data sets show that the proposed method performs better than the existing method.", "authors": [{"name": "Wei  Wu", "ids": ["39533001"]}, {"name": "Hang  Li", "ids": ["49404233"]}, {"name": "Yunhua  Hu", "ids": ["7741830"]}, {"name": "Rong  Jin", "ids": ["144723884"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["087e8dc46e9ef192e828a2287e153425173e1532", "19bb0dce99466077e9bc5a2ad4941607fc28b40c", "0af75728bec67f698a8c619645165de13780c2fa", "44605f6bd423852eb7c1a62004db72875fd971c9", "f46da42bc9e97b320a0a143c1835ac88436bcc0d", "7b2dd79083a74699e4e0509ac3f0a8a302b4eabe", "009f35c0e453f2435efd8d8ef8086b76b294967a", "dbb3342599c9b431a3152a0d5c813d3e56967a27", "141e6c1dd532504611266d08458dbe2a0dbb4e98", "6f1fdfcdf03cb4e6827d647f5d8cfbc93b33c980", "b7511b06ea23225714d81e48eb2297a91f758189", "8ff61b8e097ccdb784a35b466ba9e130c2502513", "0948365ef39ef153e61e9569ade541cf881c7c2a", "fe697b4e2cb4c132da39aed8b8266a0e6113f9f2", "944e1a7b2c5c62e952418d7684e3cade89c76f87", "47aaeb6dc682162dfe5659c2cad64e5d825ad910"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c9abe80919b6d2ae89480232613cbe50f10c77e0", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/download/3469/3880", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/view/3469", "http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/hangli/wu-aaai2011.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "537-542", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "40532924", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

While a portion of the scientific community is still devoting much effort in developing artificial tutoring systems \u2013 by deploying AI/MAS-enabled technologies \u2013 the solution being investigated by our team focuses on enhancing alreadyavailable, open source LMS by implementing a generalpurpose tracking and monitoring toolkit able to support eTutors in recognizing and dealing with pedagogical patterns stored into a decentralised Knowledge Base. The system architecture is designed to house multiple platforms (only one adapter interface needs to be written for each LMS) and is able to perform real-time, as well as scheduled, data collection by means of Jade-based agents and schedulers. Information obtained from the processed data is then returned to the platform via web services and specific interfaces (instant messaging chatbot). The first deployed prototype is currently being experimented in adult higher education learning paths and is able to track student activity, forum readings and writings and offers a basic chat-based help interface. Our aim is to turn a standard LMS into a knowledge aggregator where information about its users, its contents and interactions between the two can be mined via Knowledge Services; resulting data could then be used to refine users\u2019 and groups\u2019 profiles, to monitor learners\u2019 deviance from expected learning path, and ultimately to adjust the applied pedagogical model.", "authors": [{"name": "Pier Giuseppe Rossi", "ids": ["3061595"]}, {"name": "Simone  Carletti", "ids": ["35101334"]}, {"name": "Diego  Bonura", "ids": ["2979116"]}], "inCitations": ["73d02e15f5b8ddc6cb3cd5e91e841608b4e7ade7", "d54f07b1c159827815a8e17fed9fda60317c93ff"], "outCitations": ["fdf7bf68b57794157c5ad3345b5f977fdcd5e5b6", "455129815402c7dfc59ed9cf39b1973f839008c8", "1ff3e56ab3a1e99f7c84c37487b01f665478caa7", "f5622af8d447361fe605cffa7b90d84dc243e2e0", "7a4878719ae3b1c29400ae555ca751a3aaa9b898", "eb98cb0c6b70eb2c0f7022d9ed294bb544ca23fb"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b6a0952ad52a698abbf1d5db42116fbb807ac996", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FSS/FSS09/paper/viewFile/900/1262", "http://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FSS/FSS09/paper/view/900"], "venue": "AAAI Fall Symposium: Cognitive and Metacognitive Educational Systems", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "76-81", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2402831475", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

There are three cognitive perspectives, in order: living in the present, living in the past, and living in the future.

This appears to explain the fundamental differences between primitive cultures, traditional cultures, and modern cultures: differences in economics, politics, personality, and anthropological differences in general. So, not only does this theory succinctly explain a wide range of human behavior, but because it does, it appears to be a valid theory and a promising way to decompose abstract thought into its component parts for future cognitive research.

This is accomplished by first determining a quantitative relationship between a forcing function, such as temperature, and the modern for aminiferal response using a calibration data set based on environmental data from an oceanographic atlas and faunas generally extracted from sediment core tops. The method can be employed with a variety of environmental variables, but reconstruction of surface temperature is often the objective. The relationship developed using this training or calibration data set is then applied to down core data to infer past environmental conditions. The statistical methods that have been previously applied in this area can be grouped into three categories: linear regression based approaches, locally weighted regressions and neural networks. In addition to introducing some other learning algorithms including regression trees, bagging trees, random forest and support vector regression to this domain, in this study we suggest the use of model combination approaches to enhance the precision of estimation. By initializing with a pool of diverse predictors using a variety of learning algorithms and different samplings from the training and attribute set, a genetic algorithm was applied to select the best team of predictors.

In this work we describe three general methods for improving the use of survey resources by performing data collection with mobile devices and by directing survey progress through the application of AI techniques. First, we describe a spatial disease density model based on Gaussian process ordinal regression, which offers a better representation of the disease level distribution, as compared to the statistical approaches typically applied. Second, we show how this model can be used to dynamically route survey teams to obtain the most valuable survey possible given a fixed budget. Third, we demonstrate that the diagnosis of plant disease can be automated using images taken by a camera phone, enabling data collection by survey workers with only basic training.

This can reduce agent communication, and further, potentially increase privacy in the sense that agents reveal no more private information than is needed to determine an optimal outcome. This is not always possible: previous work has explored the tradeoff between communication cost and efficiency, and more recently, communication and privacy. We explore a third dimension: the tradeoff between privacy and efficiency. By sacrificing efficiency, we can improve the privacy of a variety of existing mechanisms. We analyze these tradeoffs in both second-price auctions and facility location problems (introducing new incremental mechanisms for facility location along the way). Our results show that sacrifices in efficiency can provide gains in privacy (and communication), in both the average and worst case.", "authors": [{"name": "Xin  Sui", "ids": ["48303902"]}, {"name": "Craig  Boutilier", "ids": ["145646162"]}], "inCitations": ["95bbe200c178853e50c23cda896a09983286a47c", "21ba01c8be3c275948452154566686a0d6bbcc05", "5886531b89ddecca93ca78d3d8dd54d1af86df15", "77331947a5da38d31ce4417c5b80f63e2c092c13", "c22ec7220886e434a9a999d71383bcdd8589425f", "8c36e6d2eff280ad08b0e5dc4479790b43e2b0ac", "bbedf3eef11a0971aca1ac9438de308453e6bd10"], "outCitations": ["f9a751c75d4fe2d3f747166be2cbee78e3910b50", "a49642da2e205a33d1370e749543521ce67f0fc3", "bca7fbd44df418eaf39e3951b270f87a4498a233", "f193f6914bff2e54e0062e5afcc421a87e5441ca", "3876eb64a983f85f7376a2963693db5f23dbd321", "2618dbd8bc6bc401fbc202342c00cd2ffefcbe4f", "728d09ee616e0fc5e78b5005ff763f284335f772", "fe23edf44805af5aa1fca0081a99b5bb4b168373", "eaaaaf0aa28dd7ae3c843b0f3745b5cf74058f3a", "aa12875188456ee50b50ae6d5b157b7307e2d0f4", "f7032fded959036873815602a1de852dfa44b9da", "1b6c2b533775051a96da1e59658bc7e016b8fc71", "99c47710cb5d5c0be302aeee517ec27e45c48e19"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/76547fabf360d524d705fc9d8ba2ba51949f75e2", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cebly/Papers/SuiBoutilier_AAAI11.pdf", "http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~nelkadri/CSI5389/Papers/168-Sui_and_Boutilier_AAAI2011.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/download/3527/3929", "http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~cebly/Papers/SuiBoutilier_AAAI11.pdf", "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/cs15-892F15/efficiency-privacy%20tradeoffs%20in%20MD.aaai11.pdf", "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/cs15-892F11/efficiency-privacy%20tradeoffs%20in%20MD.aaai11.pdf", "http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/cs15-892F11/efficiency-privacy%20tradeoffs%20in%20MD.aaai11.pdf", "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/cs15-892F13/efficiency-privacy%20tradeoffs%20in%20MD.aaai11.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/view/3527"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "738-744", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2225794812", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

In this phenomenon, the accuracy of a pattern classifier peaks as the features increase under a fixed size of training samples. Instead of estimating the distribution of class objects, the system generates a region on the feature space, in which a certain rate of class objects is included. The pattern classifier identifies the class if the object belongs to only one class of the coverage region, but answers \"unable to detect\" if the object belongs to the coverage region of more than one class or belongs to none. Here, the coverage region is simply produced from the coverage regions of each feature and then extended if necessary. Unlike the Naive-Bayes classifier, the independence of each feature is not assumed. In tests of the system on the classification of characters, the performance does not significantly decrease as the features increase unless apparently useless features are added.", "authors": [{"name": "Izumi  Suzuki", "ids": ["143721340"]}], "inCitations": ["e824d2fd5b38ceb6d782b9c7ecf12e558f8fb733"], "outCitations": ["6b20af22b0734757d9ead382b201a65f9dd637cc", "ab70012d20c58e455e2070d2385375f5279ef43f", "8a47cee153d39945112a27239ce8e75bb78dc69e", "78053512af13466c569e5946acfc3953bbfc9d36", "3626f388371b678b2f02f6eefc44fa5abc53ceb3", "2ba1accf69a041aa25d0dfbb11fd60290cfd7046"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/644ffd607d9d21b6bb0c5167507b80a4bb5eb2d4", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2011.20"], "venue": "2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops", "journalName": "2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops", "journalVolume": "1", "journalPages": "401-405", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2011.20", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2011.20", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2125746089", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

The first method is the conventional one based on the quadratic programming approach, which builds the optimal separating hyperplane maximizing the margin between two classes (SVM-Q). The second method is based on the linear programming approach suggested by Vapnik to build a separating hyperplane with the minimum number of support vectors (SVM-L). Using synthetic data from two classes, we compare the classification performance of these SVMs, with a geometrical comparison of their separating hyperplanes and support vectors. We show that both classifiers achieve practically identical classification accuracy and generalization performance. However, SVM-L has many fewer support vectors than SVM-Q. We also prove that, in contrast to SVM-Q, which selects support vectors from the margin between two classes, support vectors of SVM-L lie on the furthermost borders of the classes, at the maximum distance from the opposite class.", "authors": [{"name": "Alexey  Nefedov", "ids": ["47732449"]}, {"name": "Jiankuan  Ye", "ids": ["2016501"]}, {"name": "Casimir A.

Learning vector quantization (LVQ) is a powerful tool to solve bankruptcy prediction problem as a classification task. The genetic algorithm (GA) is applied widely in conjunction with artificial intelligent methods. The hybridization of genetic algorithm with existing classification algorithms is well illustrated in the field of bankruptcy prediction. In this paper, a hybrid GA and LVQ approach is proposed to minimize the expected misclassified cost under the asymmetric cost preference.

Most existing approaches to plan recognition and other abductive tasks employ either purely logical methods that do not handle uncertainty, or purely probabilistic methods that do not handle structured representations. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces an approach to abductive reasoning using a first-order probabilistic logic, specifically Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). It introduces several novel techniques for making MLNs efficient and effective for abduction.

This paper focuses on the jurisprudence of the Brazilian Supreme Court, demonstrating (i) that the traditional approach given to privacy in Brazil is not accurate enough to deal with the new threats which arise in the cyberspace; (ii) that the concept of privacy should be redefined when applied to the cyberspace and; (iii) that differences among national privacy legislations challenge international compliance with regard to the right to privacy.", "authors": [{"name": "Dennys Marcelo Antonialli", "ids": ["2333244"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": [], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/79e71dfa9ecc78f8a0232b289720eda7c82d7d6a", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS10/paper/download/1165/1470", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS10/paper/view/1165", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS10/paper/viewFile/1165/1470"], "venue": "AAAI Spring Symposium: Intelligent Information Privacy Management", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2408151922", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

The proposed method is based on a localized dimension reduction penalty added to the objective function for training a hyper basis function (hyper BF or generalized RBF) neural network. The localized dimension reduction in a hyper BF network is motivated by the fact that many patterns are recognized to belong to one class due to the co-occurrence of specific values along a specific set of dimensions. Furthermore, one class is very likely to be composed of multiple sub- models that are different in their characteristics. The proposed method is applied at multiple iterations. Features are ranked each iteration and a smaller subset is passed to the next iteration. A support vector machine (SVM) is used to evaluate the remaining dimensions in a ten-fold cross validation setting. Experimental results show the proposed method effectively reduces the number of dimensions from 54,613 to 65 while increasing the cross-validation classification accuracy from 92.3% to 96.4%.

In this model a node in a network can be in one of two states at any time step, and changes state if enough of its neighbors are in the opposite state, as determined by \u201cup-threshold\u201d and \u201cdown-threshold\u201d parameters. This dynamical process models several types of social contagion processes, such as public health concerns and the spread of games on online networks. Motivated by recent literature calling for the investigation of peer pressure to reduce obesity, which can be viewed as a control problem of population dynamics, we focus on the computational complexity of finding critical sets of nodes, which are nodes that we choose to freeze in state 0 (a desirable state) in order to inhibit the spread of an undesirable state 1 in the network. We define a minimum-cost critical set problem and show that it is NP-complete for bi-threshold systems. We show that several versions of the problem can be approximated to within a factor of O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the network. Using the ideas behind these approximations, we devise a heuristic, called the Maximum Contributor Heuristic (MCH), which can be used even when the diffusion model is probabilistic. We perform simulations with well-known networks from the literature and show that MCH outperforms the High Degree Heuristic by several orders of magnitude.", "authors": [{"name": "Christopher James Kuhlman", "ids": ["48450791"]}, {"name": "V.

It is important to learn how robust these hardness protection results are, in order to find whether they can be relied on in practice. This paper shows that for voters who follow the most central political-science model of electorates\u2014single-peaked preferences\u2014those protections vanish. By using single-peaked preferences to simplify combinatorial covering challenges, we show that NP-hard bribery problems\u2014including those for Kemeny and Llull elections\u2014fall to polynomial time. By using single-peaked preferences to simplify combinatorial partition challenges, we show that NP-hard partition-of-voters problems fall to polynomial time. We furthermore show that for single-peaked electorates, the winner problems for Dodgson and Kemeny elections, though \u0398p2-complete in the general case, fall to polynomial time. And we completely classify the complexity of weighted coalition manipulation for scoring protocols in single-peaked electorates.", "authors": [{"name": "Felix  Brandt", "ids": ["145199274"]}, {"name": "Markus  Brill", "ids": ["144336432"]}, {"name": "Edith  Hemaspaandra", "ids": ["5689289"]}, {"name": "Lane A.

As a step towards learning of more powerful grammars, this paper discusses the incremental learning of Linear Indexed Grammars (LIGs) for formal languages from positive and negative sample strings. We implemented methods of learning LIGs in LIG Learner system. An important feature of LIG Learner is incremental learning through rule generation mechanism called bridging and a search for rule sets. This paper reports experimental results on learning several LIGs for fundamental mildly-context-sensitive languages including the copy language, or the set of strings of the form ww, and a set of strings representing pseudo-knots in modeling RNA, as well as some RIR (right-linear-indexed right-linear) grammars, which are restricted LIGs and equivalent to context-free grammars.", "authors": [{"name": "Katsuhiko  Nakamura", "ids": ["1788782"]}, {"name": "Keita  Imada", "ids": ["2040380"]}], "inCitations": ["0d69aa41af15b0dc7a83274d8d51a1322a7a94a1", "886093475417692332e09fc39a635f7ede0e703f"], "outCitations": ["e97d67ad4d14be3263e747c918a816dbc5e18102", "9822737c773e6d81266dd8951c04a650fec17feb", "3727b0429d7bd8498125bb6f9ff9f86c1b4f6722", "e27341557452027542d1840cc07bdd7591f750da", "80ea6f15d849e0ef47e3615a82c40861b8b2d699", "349f5aca1aa8ccb456ec30cc1baca6a04bb97c6e", "00d6a9faf1ee88d7351264f3ba65db56bc370d8f", "46089bdefd265712fcda4ae3c8136a93765059f0", "b5127be01adbf83f8ec4ea43e856abbbed11baa4", "26df5acc942761136783a9874fef7de6aab273b0", "dd4d9860da48daa6bac37bae429f681cc667e88a", "3dc5d7a0ee04203f428e34bf2219d705fe61b7df", "2350cbf16800cac895b58dd5091da595822acdd6", "400d37f0fae650128ffce4cc3b4e68b48ddfc09f", "f684bfaa234d2d8d7e51feadc3d422d8f70966e4"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fed932960f17b7d9727c0e2b4f8a1b1caf1651dd", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2011.146"], "venue": "2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops", "journalName": "2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops", "journalVolume": "1", "journalPages": "223-228", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2011.146", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2011.146", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2006374346", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

A sensate skin for robots would require integration of hundreds or thousands of minute force or pressure sensors, each producing a localized response. Interpretation and extraction of useful information from the sensate skin presents a key technical challenge. In this paper we present a technique for analyzing data from tactile sensor arrays based on K-means clustering. Using a simplified contact model, the procedure estimates both magnitude and location for impacts on the sensate skin surface. Furthermore, it robustly accommodates a variety of sensor array densities by interpolating across areas of sensor response, providing accurate results even between sensing elements.", "authors": [{"name": "Harry  Chan-Maestas", "ids": ["1405689582"]}, {"name": "Donald A.

Moreover, this algorithm introduces a transmission range, and makes isolated nodes to connect to the network, by directly communicating with the Sink. Comparing with the existing algorithms, the simulation results show that TBDTS can decrease more transmission energy cost and achieve better transmission reliability.", "authors": [{"name": "Xiao-Liang  Xu", "ids": ["7925894"]}, {"name": "Jun-Na  Qiu", "ids": ["3038870"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["b3834aed2c564d2dbeacf8c1b733dbe5c9c07fbf", "c3ed671bf7c9bb71c9b791309c11f2b8f3ecf204", "0ad7ea5102451fb75bc4eafcb74f321c6ee8407a", "8df22f1d5073a05326b89247a8d0d63cbd191500", "e22301c5a8be4b6c1f9ee7b047de5d3ac36a39d3", "9222ffb8376c3ab36699e3074bf523d9fdf1e6e1", "beeb0e10aa0a884506bfcff0068fefafe990d260"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9d11a7e11d244bd2778408cbf6e080da7a2ba74f", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "6", "journalPages": "3381-3385", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212784", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212784", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2122849542", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

This scenario occurs in many real-world applications. For example, in some disease diagnosis, the cost of erroneously diagnosing a patient as healthy is much higher than that of diagnosing a healthy person as a patient. Also, the acquisition of labeled data requires medical diagnosis which is expensive, while the collection of unlabeled data such as basic health information is much cheaper. We propose the CS4VM (Cost-Sensitive Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machine) to address this problem. We show that the CS4VM, when given the label means of the unlabeled data, closely approximates the supervised cost-sensitive SVM that has access to the ground-truth labels of all the unlabeled data. This observation leads to an efficient algorithm which first estimates the label means and then trains the CS4VM with the plug-in label means by an efficient SVM solver. Experiments on a broad range of data sets show that the proposed method is capable of reducing the total cost and is computationally efficient.", "authors": [{"name": "Yu-Feng  Li", "ids": ["48514307"]}, {"name": "James T.

Often times, different data sources may represent the same data element in a slightly different way. These differences may represent an error in the data or a disagreement between sources on the correct value that best represents the data point. When the quantity of data managed and fused becomes sufficiently large, manual review becomes impossible, and automated systems must be built to manage data fusion. Some of the traditional solutions use simple voting theory, Dempster-Shafer theory, fuzzy matching and incremental learning. This paper presents a novel approach to data fusion in the domain of business listings. The task at hand, business listing categorization, suffers from conflicting and incomplete data from disparate data sources.

Our work is built upon the large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN) classification framework. Due to the semidefiniteness constraint in the optimization problem of LMNN, it is not scalable in terms of the dimensionality of the input data. The original LMNN solver partially alleviates this problem by adopting alternating projection methods instead of standard interior-point methods. Still, at each iteration, the computation complexity is at least O(D3) (D is the dimension of input data). In this work, we propose a column generation based algorithm to solve the LMNN optimization problem much more efficiently. Our algorithm is much more scalable in that at each iteration, it does not need full eigen-decomposition. Instead, we only need to find the leading eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector, which is of O(D2) complexity.

Currently, some ship relative positioning method based on the original measurement and local positioning estimate in marine ship network have been researched. Whereas, these ship relative positioning researches only make an attempt to get the novel practical positioning technology, so some assumptions are made such as synchronous working with uniform initiative time for every ship's positioning system and without data delay from other ship nodes to target ship. Therefore, these algorithms are all theoretic and not practical. Synchronously, the distributed structure with local estimate transmission is more effective than the centralized form with original positioning measurement. In order to establish the practical ship relative positioning method, the asynchronous working model across ships and data delay are both considered in this paper. Accordingly, a novel practical ship relative positioning method for general asynchronous marine network is presented. The theoretic analysis and simulation example both show the validity and practicability of the proposed method.", "authors": [{"name": "Quan-Bo  Ge", "ids": ["2780571"]}, {"name": "Bing-Lei  Guan", "ids": ["2973598"]}, {"name": "Tao  Wen", "ids": ["145915388"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["314aa4e0e5c9c6f847b96f6c4936e5e8f7be8d9e", "0816e06d36b2693c1da1b3c7e722053b251bf515", "76ea2442ba89d9eea86d95c175fb41b5a0b67c14", "fcd9250da95e8b26f95a1a7e29489a3dce63aac9", "db8a377c454df323396ebd7328077e70d72368eb", "76d72b21c233335bd02d6a6aaac6450f96bb7d25", "8093a954e3d7715bdbd7ce2c56c947443b38939d"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8db2ae048e604590a4b9a7e68eeb29614f5cb889", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "6", "journalPages": "3402-3407", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212780", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212780", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2101933792", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

This paper proposes a global community detection algorithm based on local central vertices of complex networks. Local degree central vertices are used as initial vertices, by agglomerating the neighbor nodes to local degree central vertices, the community structure can be detected. The experiment results show that our algorithm works effectively and outperforms some other algorithms in terms of modularity.", "authors": [{"name": "Qiong  Chen", "ids": ["2523385"]}, {"name": "Ming  Fang", "ids": ["145029131"]}], "inCitations": ["112ee043458ba9745ec9acb2baa3a2dfa266c98f", "1e5d0f1f239b848a2bdcd27d8ee7ff2e7491d725", "b452dce0112c1daf759c04970a897a7147670da3", "f72c64382286a00788737171b44954abd824557d"], "outCitations": ["0a0127654ad28101e70ba9d58fa895d8d65a5859", "65b5b6de48a768526f16ea98fddfa6e4e70af8c1", "2a005868b79511cf8c924cd5990e2497527a0527", "af083a825342176e439bbf082626fd642a2bde11", "2a91c8ff11a828209f10714cfc46fd929a51e9dc", "9dfc51f3d270ea86852219a664aef84f89a42898", "cefcff90c2e14f4b324a3e45a8ca66b38be45e94", "71744ae3d04171f16c7e175369cc790faaeab7ff", "555c21ca13ab0998eda2401e8e082656feec740b", "bf6252cca9e6b1632c62711033bcc747ce19b879", "5483d72c0d78e2bd459e87c1b6480472b414ab98"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/857cbf1f1aa028ad15d041ed4383d787e80ec845", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016775"], "venue": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "2", "journalPages": "920-925", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016775", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016775", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "magId": "2114926707", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

If memory is instead considered to be a fundamentally active aspect of cognition, as increasingly suggested by empiricallyderived neurophysiological theory, this passive role must be reinterpreted. In this perspective, memory is the distributed substrate of cognition, forming the foundation for cross-modal priming, and hence soft crossmodal coordination. This paper seeks to describe what a cognitive architecture based on this perspective must involve, and initiates an exploration into how humanlevel cognitive competencies (namely episodic memory, word label conjunction learning, and social behaviour) can be accounted for in such a low-level framework. This proposal of a memory-centred cognitive architecture presents new insights into the nature of cognition, with benefits for computational implementations such as generality and robustness that have only begun to be exploited.", "authors": [{"name": "Paul  Baxter", "ids": ["143997370"]}, {"name": "Rachel  Wood", "ids": ["48771505"]}, {"name": "Anthony F.

We introduce the independent syllable model and consider two ways of aggregating frame level features within a syllable. We characterize each syllable as a probability distribution of its frame level features. The independent frame independent syllable (IFIS) model allows us to distinguish syllables whose feature distributions are different from one another. The Markov chain frame independent syllable (MCFIS) model is introduced for scenarios where the temporal structure within the syllable provides significant amount of discriminative information. We derive the Bayes risk minimizing classifier for each model and show that it can be approximated as a nearest neighbour classifier. Our experiments indicate that the IFIS and MCFIS models achieve 88.26% and 90.61% correct classification rates, respectively, while the equivalent SVM implementation achieves 86.15%.", "authors": [{"name": "Balaji  Lakshminarayanan", "ids": ["40627523"]}, {"name": "Raviv  Raich", "ids": ["1911921"]}, {"name": "Xiaoli Z.

In order to effectively integrate new knowledge with existing knowledge such a system needs to be able to resolve references to the instances (agents, locations, events, etc.) it is reading about with those already existing in memory. This is necessary to extend existing memory structures, and to avoid incorrectly producing duplicate memories. Direct Memory Access Parsing (DMAP) leverages existing knowledge and performs reference resolution and memory integration in the early stages of parsing natural language text. By performing incremental memory integration our system can reduce the number of ambiguous sentence interpretations and coreference mappings it will explore in-depth, however this savings is currently canceled out by the run-time cost of reference resolution algorithm. This paper supports the continued investigation of this line of research, which is to identify and evaluate the extent to which semantic and episodic memory can facilitate natural language understanding, especially when used early in the language understanding process.", "authors": [{"name": "Kevin  Livingston", "ids": ["26837164"]}, {"name": "Christopher  Riesbeck", "ids": ["2542226"]}], "inCitations": ["9daf72727e44bef5a9ea6e74146ada22c7548f2d", "0c4d37069b8f375896ff04ec015d4f72e232f0f8", "7a333949b494854f0887d42138578ad4b847ecb2", "f9180347d384385bef5754700f5e8a9cc0dda96c", "f37b0dadb7bdad94a3ee3a10ada8607476c562b1"], "outCitations": ["ed9e69a92986926a01f244fbf45e798718f86716", "8ba4429283b265c2e42139d39680524e6180d847", "6f109c7b5341b6af8d672e863963c5bd00035daa", "89789c61fa76ff34d5b265f04b4fb04b04b1413d", "bdc08721414c972ab451f8ef3ef39d63c741b324", "fb4388debb10d149316ab66d3bb6cddffb37f0e1", "2c538ee7c17c71b2aaa53dcf3c9972c00e6e097b", "924047dc29bfd17ec264d9b90795112eb2806dc4", "e80b34a55aa56578f9a4f27ea207f8c42c93a378", "f835a17a958268f7070e1fbb683568053f30c7ff", "b6a1e6d5a94669d6f7964ed2fb4c16b891fc797d", "b1e7bf85c7caf1306fa27802218a8e2cdc8f4268", "1d96dd3e1035b435f65e7b209cce3e1d7c379d83", "9ef07373873cc0f0b940512dcdde4e7b54b0cfb0", "b43991e13bd95050c85e8676664197e99a66c29b", "f50676817135afccf34c16bdaf0e4f7e9000d4b4", "95966b12f076402d0cf4e8065aa77d58fc5dfaf6", "dce5ae976cce9b0bd0b174e7656def29c7b60e5c"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2f294fa6aefbc5f0c8c568bd7803d4bae28b5bbe", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://cs.northwestern.edu/~livingston/papers/livingston-aaai-spring09.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Spring/2009/ss09-07-010.php"], "venue": "AAAI Spring Symposium: Learning by Reading and Learning to Read", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "58-64", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2400389711", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

In this work we describe an approach that facilitates the automatic recognition of relationships defined between two different concepts in text. Unlike the traditional bag-of-words representation, in this work, a relationship is represented with a scheme of five distinct context-blocks based on the position of concepts in the text. This scheme was applied to eight different relationships, between medical problems, treatments and tests, on a set of 349 patient records from the 4th i2b2 challenge. Results show that the context-block representation was very successful (F-Measure = 0.775) compared to the bag-of-words model (F-Measure = 0.402).

However, the commonly used Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE) approaches, do not automatically accommodate replicated measurements. Often, an ad hoc step of preprocessing e. g. averaging, either weighted, un-weighted or something in between is needed, which might wipe out important patterns of low magnitude and/or cancel out patterns of similar magnitude. We treat each replicate individually as a random variable and design a finite mixture model to estimate an optimal correlation structure from replicated molecular profiling data. Assuming that the measurements are independently, identically distributed (i. i. d.) samples from a mixture of two multivariate normal distributions, one with a constrained set of parameters and the other with an unconstrained parameter structure, we employ an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate component parameters. We carry out a comparative study, including both simulations and real-world data analysis, to assess the estimation of correlation structure using the proposed model and the constrained model given by the first component of the mixture. The two models were further tested for their performances in clustering real-world data. The mixture model approach is shown to have an overall better performance.", "authors": [{"name": "Lipi R.

In particular, we consider tasks in which a set of items are connected to each other by given relationships yielding a graph, whose nodes correspond to the available objects, and it is required to estimate a set of functions defined on each node of the graph, given a small set of labeled nodes for each function. The available prior knowledge imposes a set of constraints among the function values. In particular, we consider background knowledge expressed as FOL clauses, whose predicates correspond to the functions and whose variables range over the nodes of the graph. These clauses can be converted into a set of constraints that can be embedded into a graph regularization schema. The experimental results evaluate the proposed technique on an image tagging task, showing how the proposed approach provides a significantly higher tagging accuracy than simple graph regularization.", "authors": [{"name": "Claudio  Sacc\u00e0", "ids": ["2739140"]}, {"name": "Michelangelo  Diligenti", "ids": ["1767359"]}, {"name": "Marco  Gori", "ids": ["145467467"]}, {"name": "Marco  Maggini", "ids": ["35251916"]}], "inCitations": ["5a250d5f7f1d3702d7cc1505fecfd8c43959a311", "1f7c42d54173c8e1d788ca6bbc390fd0347ffc2b", "56f59b1f721e32700a638e77fff29ac18a0e0feb"], "outCitations": ["ee2431aaccf439cd9b9f7b1195b7fde31212c831", "80c787321bc7dbd449ed07e61c032c30f4ed81a1", "245bfe16ffc5deee5b888b8a6ccddc132fdb56d8", "2a784e1f47720beb190a42fcf5c94a2854985de7", "19bb0dce99466077e9bc5a2ad4941607fc28b40c", "d5650bfe8b544669f21be552e77be6a23ba6221b", "46770a8e7e2af28f5253e5961f709be74e34c1f6", "968e87347d92bc275e47ec2b51f9685ecb896caf"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a5dedde8ff4dd1dfa4322c0c391afa06e1b3761e", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2011.156"], "venue": "2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops", "journalName": "2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops", "journalVolume": "2", "journalPages": "251-256", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2011.156", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2011.156", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2098358887", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

The discrete Choquet integral respect to a fuzzy measure is proved to be an adequate aggregation operator by further taking into accounts the interactions among criteria. A signed fuzzy measure is needed when the gain and loss must be considered in the same time. In this study, we propose a signed fuzzy measure based on the complexity method to construct a signed fuzzy measure needed by the discrete generalized Choquet integral and a real questionnaire data is analyzed. The advantage of the complexity-based method is that no population probability is to be estimated such that the error of estimating the population probability is reduced and it is easily to construct a signed fuzzy measure based on the complexity method. Four methods, including the discrete Choquet integral with fuzzy measure based on the entropy method, the discrete Choquet integral with fuzzy measure based on the complexity method, the discrete generalized Choquet integral with signed fuzzy measure based on the cardinality method, and our proposed discrete generalized Choquet integral with signed fuzzy measure based on the complexity method, are used in this study to evaluate the overall satisfaction of the patients.

To establish a process model, the identification of the appropriate process is essential. In addition, this process model has to feature a quality of execution to enable forward-looking properties like an online prediction mode. This report argues that the agent-based identification is appropriate to this modelling issue. Although there were many predecessor approaches, which tried to design formal models of manufacturing processes, all of them fell short of the data based identification of complex systems, like paper manufacturing: complex systems consisting of continuous and discrete parts, called hybrid manufacturing systems. This paper focuses on the system identification with agent based evolutionary computation using a local optimization kernel.

In such difficult working conditions, leading to high turn-over of low-paid employees, automation is desirable, especially in large-scale kitchens of hospitals, navy ships, schools, hotels and other dining facilities. Our project is a part of developing an integrated machine vision sorting and inspecting system for mixed dish pieces and silverware exiting a flight-type commercial dishwashing machine, coupled with automatic loading and unloading. We propose two new methods for automatically inspecting dish cleanliness, namely adaptive thresholding and maximum saliency map. On the first method, a new technique using partitioning and adaptive thresholding, combined with global thresholding are introduced. On the second method, we propose a new normalization technique. Both algorithms are fast, simple, and produce results invariant with lighting conditions and dish rotation about the camera-dish axis. Algorithms are written and tested by Matlab\u00d2 R14 and Image Processing Toolbox V5.0 to 110 dish images taken in different lighting condition using different position of 51 separate dishes (either clean or dirty) of our dish set, in which 77 images are from dirty dishes with 799 dirty points in these dishes. The adaptive thresholding method produces 95.0% and 96.5% accuracies in discriminating clean from dirty dishes and dirty spot detection, respectively. While the maximum saliency map method produces 100% accuracies in discriminating clean from dirty dishes and 93.5% accuracies in and dirty spot detection.", "authors": [{"name": "Trung H.

Then we propose Localized K-flats algorithm (LKF), which introduces localized representations of linear models and a new distortion measure, to remove confusion among different clusters.

{"id": "f3ed8e38a89e8382e1dd66f0ee06ad31c1db57ac", "title": "Documenting Models and their Relations with Semantic Wikis", "text": "The unified documentation of models and their relations which vary greatly in regard to the description view, the abstraction level, the language used and the purpose for which they have been built is challenging. The knowledge about the relations which exist between models created with a diverse set of tools is usually not captured in a systematic way and hence cannot be searched and reused across different projects and stakeholders. Therefore we suggest semantic wikis for the collection of this knowledge. The Problem of Managing Model Relations The current situation in process management can be characterized by language pluralism. Although with BPMN a de facto standard is emerging, not all economically relevant facts can be described with BPMN. In general, languages used to construct models from a business perspective (e.g. EPC, UML Activity Diagram, IDEF3) differ from those used to construct executable models (e.g. BPMN, BPEL, XL and XPDL) for example in regard to the extent to which exceptions and failures can be represented. Moreover, different models on different levels of abstraction from information technology are created (Lippe et al. 2005, p. 9). Although present modeling tools allow to capture some limited relationships between models e.g. in the form of hierarchical decompositions, complex semantic relations spanning multiple modeling tools and repositories are not captured sufficiently, although this demand has already been identified in literature (Lippe et al. 2005; Boudjlida et al. 2005). Therefore a uniform documentation of the models and their relations is usually not practiced. The result of this is that the knowledge around the various semantic model relations such as \u201cis derived from\u201d, \u201cdetails\u201d or \u201cimplements\u201d is only implicitly contained in the mental models of individual employees of an organization. Moreover, it is not amenable to machine processing. This causes manifold disadvantages; one of them is for example that the analysis and search of dependencies between models is not possible. Semantic wikis provide a potential solution to this problem. In general, semantic wikis extend wiki systems for collaborative content management with semantic technologies aiming at enhanced navigation, search and retrieval possibilities (Krotzsch et al. 2007, p. 1). Semantic wikis therefore provide the possibility of representing model relationships in an explicit and formal way by using concepts of a formal model such as an ontology.", "authors": [{"name": "Michael  Fellmann", "ids": ["1759200"]}, {"name": "Oliver  Thomas", "ids": ["145589042"]}, {"name": "Thorsten  Dollmann", "ids": ["3108822"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["88d472091487ad66fe1bcd02b75ef39970232658", "15bf00c00718e2a43cef1689f0bf3fa7ada56f20", "fca1097b6ca745cb5727c6552a78e2359eefe25a", "672ca8baeefb5a27ac0048ccf3e177d35973ba5b", "6988e022b403fac69a6485729f4649a6977068f0", "4020e3beb354734c7068d7fe6220f977feb4379d", "28e397cb718fe8bf78e8fb293d8ef06a60013a8a", "5b3d0d41befccf98dd4fe8c924843ffbdcda8ac8"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f3ed8e38a89e8382e1dd66f0ee06ad31c1db57ac", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Spring/2009/ss09-08-005.php", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Spring/2009/SS-09-08/SS09-08-005.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI Spring Symposium: Social Semantic Web: Where Web 2.0 Meets Web 3.0", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "17-18", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2402191078", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Autonomous guidance is relevant because use of canines, though beneficial in many applications, is limited by the necessity of close human supervision. A rules-based expert system using GPS data was initially developed for this purpose. This rules-based system is not without limitations. Primarily, it takes a significant investment of trainer and developer time to derive appropriate values to use for control of the canine. A multi-objective fitness metric was developed to optimize for important parts of the control algorithm, and parameters of the algorithm were optimized using evolutionary computation. In simulations the evolved parameters fit the data better than the hand-tuned parameters, and preliminary field trials showed a 67% mission success rate, which shows the feasibility of evolving parameters for the control algorithm.", "authors": [{"name": "William  Lyles", "ids": ["50852362"]}, {"name": "Winard  Britt", "ids": ["1843292"]}, {"name": "David M.

Identification of essential genes is of theoretical interest to genome biologist and has practical applications in medicine and biotechnology. This paper presents and evaluates machine learning approaches to the problem of predicting essential genes in microbial genomes using solely sequence derived input features. We investigate three different supervised classification methods -- Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Decision Tree (DT) -- for this binary classification task. The classifiers are trained and evaluated using 37830 examples obtained from 14 experimentally validated, taxonomically diverse microbial genomes whose essential genes are known. A set of 52 relevant genomic sequence derived features is used as input for the classifiers. The models were evaluated using novel blind testing schemes Leave-One-Genome-Out (LOGO) and Leave-One-Taxon-group-Out (LOTO) and 10-fold stratified cross validation (10-f-cv) strategy on both the full multi-genome datasets and its class imbalance reduced variants. Experimental results (10 X 10-f-cv) indicate SVM and ANN perform better than DT with Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (AU-ROC) scores of 0.80, 0.79 and 0.68 respectively. This study demonstrates that supervised machine learning methods can be used to predict essential genes in microbial genomes by using only gene sequence and features derived from it.

Using this matrix, we can collect information regarding the relationship between design requirements and design attributes in terms of linguistic variables from experts' questionnaire. From the questionnaire, the fuzzy number of product packaging design attributes can be found using the fuzzy integral method, and the priority of design attributes can be obtained.

To check the correctness of this assumption we conducted some empirical case studies in which we compared the performance of a qualitative constraint solver with different automated reasoning systems, namely first-order and description logic reasoners. We also report on some first results from comparing the performance of qualitative and finite constraint solvers. Our empirical tests are based on randomly generated instances of qualitative constraint satisfaction problems, which have been encoded as reasoning problems for first-order reasoners, description logic reasoners, and finite CSP solvers, respectively. Given our currently used encodings, these studies show that first-order and description logic reasoners are far from being feasible for problem sizes that can easily be solved by a qualitative reasoner. In contrast, finite CSP solvers are competitive, but still outperformed by a qualitative reasoner on the problem instances considered here.", "authors": [{"name": "Matthias  Westphal", "ids": ["38538688"]}, {"name": "Stefan  W\u00f6lfl", "ids": ["46284215"]}], "inCitations": ["14087ea563df935952b638806a586c397ef557d5", "5f3c29c1d4eaf50ae72b3d6a23c97faa603b83d6", "e0ffe552bc243b0a044692f241b9bf8ab8a0bb63", "5f1c8801eb3e4aba93e821a5094c058458d04978", "cdc839f7ae491c5ca3b87528f06a0ece1f86dde7"], "outCitations": ["f4d642d674aa63aafc11562c2557cb4772946147", "fde94de51281225773a1fc9d7f5e992df97abca7", "8a37e141ffbc3da67e153fd49daa314ea011f242", "bcab1e9c759571213733a66450efaac9cfffa3ad", "7cabc21f57b5df93534151df4cc5d09e64db2ad6", "07501f65241c79830736103e671507c5bbbdc7c8", "9421825e01e312fa42b8205975be41ffb9e752f7", "31f687621abfb19bcbe8c60c477b209e17e33bbf", "06e546852f42cff4d696c10146524daa548436ab", "5c57fedfc17cdec40ae0e0aa89a61c64d91c3019", "75cbc49e29556212d4a209caf4c8aff46c9df563", "d706be98aabadd70a626b0d8a37033776ee40298", "52a98d49dc8f2bb11def0bf07600b708ede96553", "e333ad683393fbb00e37390ea3f5756ec2975ea1", "f316538a8a2306cc2f8cbff354565b9ec0fc17ec", "30cdfd5f98906bca278e4036e95c8b398553cdaa", "8b0811e52f9b28712b72695b9dc2b123029ede7a", "8593eb3d723aab3ef47f7acc9cec1bea9ab8470d", "521afbe7e0ba8017b8dcdd1d26b56daac7cebf8a", "0384c7654fd861043bd4d20fd113f79dbc0f1723", "905e5af7e6e58c72773a1aac18e60a1ae012ed88", "e333828f5aca95fcdb796c7924d16cbf1a5efebb"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d452d7c2c16b6e12afc184ceb27e0f9b4b39bfc2", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matthias_Westphal/publication/221250507_Confirming_the_QSR_Promise/links/0912f5093d65aad268000000.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Spring/2009/ss09-02-008.php", "http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~ki/papers/westphal-woelfl-aaaiss09.pdf", "http://gki.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/papers/westphal-woelfl-aaaiss09.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Spring/2009/SS-09-02/SS09-02-008.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI Spring Symposium: Benchmarking of Qualitative Spatial and Temporal Reasoning Systems", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "41-46", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2400972501", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

We employ a minimalist approach in which InfraRed and contact sensors form the primary means of communication; the agents physically embody the elements of the tree through their position and other agents can either follow the tree to useful locations or expand the tree by becoming part of it. Although robots are constrained in some of the operations they may perform in space, we argue that our approach remains consistent with the original data-structure. We demonstrate that one may perform a planning query from a point to the tree origin directly via message passing where passing involves direct physical motion or simple IR messages. Based on the work done by Werger and Mataric , our implementation proves that it is possible to form and maintain a RRT using simple position unaware robots.

This style of human/agent interaction allows the human teacher to issue natural-language commands and demonstrate ground actions, thereby alleviating the need for advanced teaching interfaces or difficult goal encodings. The framework extends prior work in apprenticeship learning and builds off of recent advancements in learning to recognize activities and modeling domains with multiple objects. In our studies, we show how to both learn a verb model and turn it into reward and heuristic functions that can then be composed with a dynamics model. The resulting \"combined model\" can then be efficiently searched by a sample-based planner which determines a policy for enacting a verb command in a given environment. Our experiments with a simulated robot domain show this framework can be used to quickly teach verb commands that the agent can then enact in new environments.", "authors": [{"name": "Daniel  Hewlett", "ids": ["34979516"]}, {"name": "Thomas J.

The process of correcting errors can not only reduce users' performance, but can also lead to frustration. While making fewer recognition errors is undoubtedly helpful, facilities for supporting user-guided correction are also critical. We explore how to better support user corrections using Parakeet - a continuous speech recognition system for text entry. Parakeet's interface is designed for easy error correction on a mobile touch-screen device. Users correct errors by selecting alternative words from a word confusion network and by typing on a predictive software keyboard. Our interface design was guided by computational experiments and used a variety of information sources to aid the correction process. In user studies, participants were able to write text efficiently despite sometimes high initial recognition error rates. Using Parakeet as an example, we discuss principles we found were important for building an effective speech correction interface.", "authors": [{"name": "Keith  Vertanen", "ids": ["2314856"]}, {"name": "Per Ola Kristensson", "ids": ["1683133"]}], "inCitations": ["29639c6e9c0000eb64a77928c0119946c45f269a", "a9e19aeb33b560f5c5b7e3de85b630fca73b85f2", "911eaf303fe32c7f1d68d15f56f185fde16a38c0", "30fcd219e51036fc94dbcf4bf0348479be4c16a7", "806296bcb646df94edd857d79b108d4efbd47513", "9b0f855ab7037789947e40c6668399962bfffbbf", "1df6f0bf50f86aabc66da59d751490bf231f5d0e", "d6ca0e4fa23cca3fe05cb0f2cd10e9c633d0cdfa", "ff2140a33563898ceddd0f809bfe2270cb129740", "1402dcadfab827912f90ffaaaa493d354e7811e3"], "outCitations": ["f302a4558dfc1c538eeb498bea2a172b4c039fab", "4b81b7282f9cc928486ee3ad008f23fe76ed6353", "0d8f907bb0180912d1e1df279739e45dff6853ee", "81c4b252384854dd8b1999575e797c7155408feb", "cb7b11223bfd4a1deda698744e708686b1cde878", "8e654213ea52acbc4f91299a6ebff58cd748f4c2", "c060e5365c38ea5cf82dd5517e8a965e90135dff", "8f041ec5eb741992b636e79b18ddc9ce4e5b2a7a", "ba06a6547115a82a3c02a35342f39a0566ce4add", "f7d08c4fdf359f5cf0946a4a86db52d273a59ba4"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d2f94e1ababe4ac7438d159cc390075e70ca0928", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://pokristensson.com/pubs/VertanenKristenssonAAAI2010.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1914/2286/", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1914", "http://www.keithv.com/pub/humanguided/human_guided_correction.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1914/2286"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1698-1701", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1519147438", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

All of this can cause some dies mismatch in the sorting stage, which is never allowed. In order to get integrated match of dies, the position relations between adjacent dies are considered, techniques including diagnosing criterion of position relatives, redundant visual scanning, forward and backtrack algorithm with cross priority are put forward.

When dies arrange in good order, match rate is more than 99.5%, by compassion, that of traditional index method is less than 92%.

To control this system, the user must adjust the agent program parameters, which indirectly modifies the flocking behavior. This is unintuitive because the properties of the flocking behavior are non-explicit in the agent program. In this paper, we discuss a domain-independent approach for detecting and controlling two emergent properties of boids: density and a qualitative threshold effect of swarming vs. flocking. Also, we discuss the possibility of applying this approach to detecting and controlling traffic jams in traffic simulations.", "authors": [{"name": "Don  Miner", "ids": ["30845054"]}, {"name": "Marie  desJardins", "ids": ["144980202"]}], "inCitations": ["4ebdf6b1dd59d008b422c31ac4648f1e53d703dd", "8dd9bf9c9ff333dee975b0554c4f4f0c092c8666", "96ac5be797062de8b7fcd095d4d4680252b1feaa", "2ef900e352fdfe968b5d910cf5a3f310e2e45cc8", "c7824cd5f9911ebc9ebd90693c1d608d87fac022", "ab14c9329bd6bb83e53186a93ae7863ea1590180", "4674a6e1b6af73970a4bb2bd9873d35a87a8a33b", "c777a713057408a640f1114709096051f34c421f", "af34e95f3a384a9d497e20a092706d6e2c366250", "d734c0ffe4b399d664e4dd38d1aff8b703d1e911", "e7c13ba184f446a97d025df0d4c8e2ffa64fc442"], "outCitations": ["06bb5771e6b8a9356c5f4ae28c98b4397c043349", "3ab6c279f53a0a535c88832ad89f7083bbb9832c", "9a6afce5e28d6c0b756304eb730025e3ab4fce4d", "38bd434b2ba5652486befaf1ec1dc3fb4501ce73", "66ba795686227fe00cb104a1d3b583730a74fff1", "5512be993773e23a4f5461104d7c813ac5b2f42f"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9675b12ef3ec3b0f39404f4d28ae4fdf58229530", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://maple.cs.umbc.edu/~don/projects/SAF/cas-treshold-fs09.pdf", "http://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FSS/FSS09/paper/view/909"], "venue": "AAAI Fall Symposium: Complex Adaptive Systems and the Threshold Effect", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "205162669", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

While there has been an increased interest in developing relational fully observable MDPs, there has been very little work on relational partially observable MDPs (POMDP), which deal with uncertainty in problem states in addition to stochastic action effects. This paper provides a concrete formalization of relational POMDPs making several technical contributions toward their solution. First, we show that to maintain correctness one must distinguish between quantification over states and quantification over belief states; this implies that solutions based on value iteration are inherently limited to the finite horizon case. Second, we provide a symbolic dynamic programing algorithm for finite horizon relational POMDPs, solving them at an abstract level, by lifting the propositional incremental pruning algorithm. Third, we show that this algorithm can be implemented using first order decision diagrams, a compact representation for functions over relational structures, that has been recently used to solve relational MDPs.", "authors": [{"name": "Chenggang  Wang", "ids": ["48586680"]}, {"name": "Roni  Khardon", "ids": ["1746048"]}], "inCitations": ["3b7ce6726bf0a60070d2258dc1225f3104d3ab1c", "1663959222cacaedce05520bdab703348ebbb22e", "dde3c2431abc4d1153e4867d001b9439488a3ffb", "67b8f5dfe742c17970961e728e3451612c15c62e", "ef9c7f30cdbd266e94ea9e83b55cfdf0786d2b40", "5a5061077fd4e0978f15290b4869887374b86a92", "6f8f974ea5d038dd51958849f819579e3a3b4ee2", "e5ce1e2222ae553c1762aa61e93bd3ee74d18acd", "ac6c704c4749bb9c8138c1619567af41fa6f7adf", "ecbca239e004a606b0517ff08997515fd5299f1c", "cf2a67025d8f6b1d9666adf106158a4b82ff24b0", "8f0e4b196fb1fe855ab7a42ce96cb631cf321a82", "6d4dec818ae36bda7dcc9f8fa7aff24e4a68d7bb", "4c4d818fa190f8f1fc8214c0dfa96292aaac4988", "04b0a2d8f98bce01a345af0931a713330467eb84", "579f8a1f41ac3f1040ce21a0f5a4fcf97cd88ad9", "811e790864c08aebd875248770d71a2ec9e979b4", "448dc7666ea457dc1de66b1384c06ba7f3e4650f", "2f6d60e41f6537f890c15376a5fbd4f8253a20dd", "49490378ad40fadbffe1e81c8b169c83a067164c", "a48a35eaae04002d735f6e7622f246582c4e53eb", "812de51ea15a8e317561fa00d133d6548cf088a7", "181558ec38be6a5afa436ef11e89106d7b6d48eb", "2868ac871287ee4917ac360e3d8990e9c4734575", "06996e180cab25c3644387bd93fb6bad6cb76556", "da3059ea0db45b39d68ae7b61c59003887208eb7", "498e1a6073501d5c2fd95f77dcd51cf02c6b2364", "ce2afa4c57366952d7885e3418650f1f54f92387"], "outCitations": ["5bde2c31982c6bf9b8924de17e9e592ff4928a94", "fe616ed3e042e181f2082090e761daab7bd9d235", "23a8215d1f1eb73dba880cb76019ede9724fa514", "ad7ace68720f7dc2fbc8474cd3f6e3a734973c22", "8defd9a7a432a3be38ea70f7f8abe2762832e0d3", "5a5061077fd4e0978f15290b4869887374b86a92", "1ba37f3940bac344506d0f09ba21172b52cbb1fe", "3139b1a80229b09e8b8498f0511eba0afe7a805c", "15ab69bd8b5362ee7d009909a57f41bda12a461b", "0d05475324a4e055329c3d5b6344d9a7f42f56d2", "e4375ea6e6dcf846c6e4d809b05ab1ac55b20a78", "8d38bdcd9e83e292da6cde9fcbd3e42cbad1a800", "690f5674ce19f6c0e7a6393e1c12aaae79a58036", "9d239a096db28070adb8e2e48cf1d42b6ffadd3e", "0a4ecb6d0cec1f6e77da2d69ac56c59c4f6aff5b", "96d3e8bc6cdc99e79fb16299d5bdda87002eb7b4", "9692a70d08376d9709eb7ed66472b661ba7c9cb5", "54766230de13caafee3509ff495effbee22456f8", "a32e1acbbc471bca51393bd5fb7ed14ac2ad8239", "9cfb05e1bc5a7aaf144b55c5b00a1f43d89397c3", "37d83b03320b79098f51fc8837dd99142c69d16a", "9d59f87b881017e6ef0198636a77ad04b7ebea7a"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ba49171391ea534fca90d8cc98257f162276dab9", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1714", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1714/2168", "http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~roni/PUB/aaai2010-rpomdp.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1153-1158", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2113805664", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

While it is well understood that data generated from mobile phones includes a record of phone calls, there are also more sophisticated data types, such as Bluetooth or cell tower proximity logging, which reveal movement patterns and day-to-day human interactions. We explore the possibility of using mobile phone data to compare movement and communication patterns across cultures. The goal of this proof-of-concept study is to quantify behavior in order to compare different populations. We compare our ability to predict future calling behavior and movement patterns from the cellular phone data of subjects in two distinct groups: a set of university students at MIT in the United States and the University of Nairobi in Kenya.

Even researchers make mistakes when labeling data, and consistent, reliable labels from low-commitment users are rare. In particular, users may give identical labels to activities with characteristically different signatures (e.g., labeling eating at home or at a restaurant as \"dinner\") or may give different labels to the same context (e.g., \"work\" vs. \"office\"). In this scenario, labels are unreliable but nonetheless contain valuable information for classification. To facilitate learning in such unconstrained labeling scenarios, we propose Community-Guided Learning (CGL), a framework that allows existing classifiers to learn robustly from unreliably-labeled user-submitted data. CGL exploits the underlying structure in the data and the unconstrained labels to intelligently group crowd-sourced data. We demonstrate how to use similarity measures to determine when and how to split and merge contributions from different labeled categories and present experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.", "authors": [{"name": "Daniel  Peebles", "ids": ["33688602"]}, {"name": "Hong  Lu", "ids": ["144315937"]}, {"name": "Nicholas D.

In such ad hoc team settings, team strategies cannot be developed a priori. Rather, an agent must be prepared to cooperate with many types of teammates: it must collaborate without pre-coordination. This paper challenges the AI community to develop theory and to implement prototypes of ad hoc team agents. It defines the concept of ad hoc team agents, specifies an evaluation paradigm, and provides examples of possible theoretical and empirical approaches to challenge. The goal is to encourage progress towards this ambitious, newly realistic, and increasingly important research goal.", "authors": [{"name": "Peter  Stone", "ids": ["144848112"]}, {"name": "Gal A.

An adaptive inverse control approach was used a vector controlled PMSM drive control system with uncertainties and external disturbances (the work condition variation). The drive system adopts two closed loop structure including velocity and current. The velocity and current loops adopt the maximum torque/current control strategy based on vector control. Thus, the current of \u201cd-q\u201d axis was computed under the condition of maximum torque by using the torque equations, and vector control relation was then obtained, and the maximum torque/current control was achieved based on vector. Due to the time varying nature and the high-bandwidth property of the uncertainties in a practical PMSM drive system, to reach exact speed control in electric vehicle drive system, the velocity loop adopts adaptive inverse control strategy based on the idea applying inverse control and adaptive control to assign signal. This control strategy deals with assign signal and interference signal respectively and eliminate noise effect on velocity output radically. Finally, the performance of the drive control system was evaluated through simulation and real-time implementation and experimental results validate the effectiveness.", "authors": [{"name": "Rui-Hua  Li", "ids": ["50392243"]}, {"name": "Jian-Fei  Zhao", "ids": ["13171506"]}, {"name": "Bo  Hu", "ids": ["145949474"]}, {"name": "Guo-Qing  Xu", "ids": ["2430300"]}], "inCitations": ["713c1f4bea9cbafdf9943d70bb1995db1f2c03ce", "fffc231c5a2ea14936cf0882a5f2403b2ab9e8e2", "7afb8abfd72d9fe61a787bd2a9bcb3b10b21cbfb"], "outCitations": ["d291dfed150d7cf81c8ddbbaef337c64dc7d3f94", "493db21ece0eb437ba3246387bb5e584a933fceb", "d6c63da7cb776da7e5f183b3c3e505deb33b6822", "d1bce0419dc084accc3e3cf0e25baf1b5806b630", "2c8769c19dbb3952106a6444db1ab439aeb6f6f0", "cb602795e6bdcf0938761ca08e77df4e9842ba9f", "881618fe3dcd1f9588c021c673ab41e84528e9ec", "83d2e9fa36f447c0608ba73209b572f554de6096", "f4bbd5b58d561d23ce9ac2d54c3fa3c721f01e54", "edcafb08cb111ecbc77e40af2999f0f60f6cb45c", "338761eeda4efdb6874e57bc6c5a71985c029196", "c7822d12beec5cfa81c48ced04d34d4ecf2654b5", "ac8d28cf5c7b52731f24ebb6399befc9a231fea4", "006f71976fce17c3722c6b31026a954ac51c0751"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1c70258d99f4e21ae96aba4a0cb48339f8354fb6", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "4", "journalPages": "1909-1914", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212190", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212190", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2112425393", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Usually, one of them is melody track, and others accompaniment tracks. To recognize the melody track from multiple tracks is important for the music retrieval and other music related applications. Though lots of researchers had researched on this topic, more efficient and precise methods are still needed. An innovative method based on the improved neural network to distinguish melody from accompaniment is proposed to recognize the melody track from multiple tracks. A set of features from each track of the MIDI file are extracted. These features are input into an improved neural network classifier that assigns the probability of being a melodic line to each track. Then, the track with the highest probability is chosen as the melodic line of the MIDI file. Experiments show that when compared with other methods, the proposed approach is outperformed in recognition precision and is effective for solving the melody recognition problem.", "authors": [{"name": "Jiangtao  Li", "ids": ["40340643"]}, {"name": "Xiaohong  Yang", "ids": ["145713448"]}, {"name": "Qingcai  Chen", "ids": ["144159781"]}], "inCitations": ["116e1f49ce9b649c75fc5b9b03933b1b61cd60ef", "369baff75b4052b10f79527ffd73e499a15345d5", "6589a22d65233f7608f123da46bdd5a7130cf9dd"], "outCitations": ["c9e378fac5852192a5f1dd9dad5922532ec4e263", "3725ab281d042c042460b307654a520acdac3833", "1666a6635f9ab3b0c0a8d924367d28281c7fb84a", "b0dbbfe10f4896d28a31243e0d381d0122735b54", "0db119a4917382d90a7d14f7de2109ca081388c5", "6f1e84a1f20d89d548fa301f312ba496c97fb885", "c1d7e3b74249ff5718b90e73bd5b26d225c610a3", "2d5e8044c0de765c37cd5f58be12582ae107e90f", "dbc0a468ab103ae29717703d4aa9f682f6a2b664", "9b186d37358aca6a98e8ff42299266b0d9781ba5", "8aca085f521d801f971e6b08e807c9c1b7d0e8e0", "f8b17b3ebeb0b8ba4e308b931e987e2f3392428b", "be760230e64f4132518cf121ec0604b671f8cc59", "6b57d1e93cde65d12ab6aba955a79d5c2e438eba", "88b98d7b20ede342fe471b2889ace70d082e4db7"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0c90ff07ca7f40d0732addc11bdebe68b9f66564", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "2", "journalPages": "1133-1138", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212378", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212378", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2105557391", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

In that case, the predictive position of the Kalman filter is regarded as its measured value. Make the Kalman filter has the ability to estimate the coming state.

Based on the fact that most of Japanese puzzle are compact and contiguous, some logical rules are deduced to paint some cells. Then, the DFS algorithm with the \u201cbranch and bound\u201d scheme, which is used to do early termination for those impossible paths, is used to solve those undetermined cells.

Two new measures, i.e. confidence degree of feedback and trustworthiness degree of recommending, are introduced to the model. The former represents the confidence of the recommender to its feedback.

Finally, the useful information obtained are evaluated in a Naive Bayes algorithm. The power and the size of wind turbine are determined automatically using data measured.

In this paper, a multi-level example based learning method for partially supervised text classification is proposed, which can make full use of all unlabeled examples. A heuristic method is proposed to assign possible labels to unlabeled examples and partition them into multiple levels according to their labeling confidence. A text classifier is trained on these multi-level examples using weighted support vector machines.

We have two primary means of understanding people \u2014 observing what they do, and what they say. As the AI4D community has noted, people's increased use of mobile devices has led to a wealth of new data relevant to these topics. We are on the cusp of developing incredibly powerful tools that can help us understand how human beings migrate, transact and acquire wealth. This could have a large impact on how we determine policies and allocate resources. Most of this analysis has tended to focus on what people do \u2014 where they go, who they talk to, what they buy, etc. I argue that what people say is an equally rich source of development data, often containing information that cannot be obtained from people's actions, such as their needs, hopes and aspirations. Voice is the most natural form of communication, especially for people who speak a non-mainstream language, and/or have marginal literacy skills.\u00a0 These are often exactly those populations who are most disenfranchised, and therefore most need their voices to be heard.", "authors": [{"name": "Tapan S.

The probabilistic neural network classifier was created for recognition of corn seedlings and weeds according to the shape features. Comparing the probabilistic neural network (PNN) method with the back-propagation neural network one, the former is better than the latter seeing from the experimental results.

However, careful orchestration and scaffolding are usually needed to achieve its full potential. In this paper, we describe our efforts at implementing a software suite to meet the cognitive and meta-cognitive needs of learners engaged in DBL. In Study 1, our software suite gave learners the opportunity to design in simulation, to run experiments to learn the effects of variables, and it scaffolded science explanation construction. Through our analysis of study 1 we identified both cognitive and metacognitive needs that the software did not provide for. To meet these additional requirements, we added an interactive science resource and a case library to the software to provide multi-representational content material, to facilitate exploration, and to invite metacognitive reflection needed to do well at learning through design. Learners recognized what they did not understand, took initiative to explore those science concepts, and applied them in novel ways. We present here our analysis of the kinds of metacognitive help learners need to productively learn from design activities and some ways of providing that help. Our conclusion is that cognitive aid without related metacognitive aid is insufficient in a DBL environment.", "authors": [{"name": "Ganesh Prasad Bhat", "ids": ["144758078"]}, {"name": "Janet L.

While these improve average execution times, they introduce additional complexity in determining the Worst Case Execution Times crucial for Real-Time Systems. In this paper, an approach is presented that utilises Bayesian Networks in order to more accurately estimate the worst-case caching behaviour of programs. With this method, a Bayesian Network is learned from traces of program execution that allows both constructive and destructive dependencies between instructions to be determined and a joint distribution over the number of cache hits to be found. Attention is given to the question of how the accuracy of the network depends on both the number of observations used for learning and the cardinality of the set of potential parents considered by the learning algorithm.", "authors": [{"name": "Mark  Bartlett", "ids": ["144935157"]}, {"name": "Iain  Bate", "ids": ["1797635"]}, {"name": "James  Cussens", "ids": ["1744430"]}], "inCitations": ["ac788de53d0bd509eac6a8b672f9806aef7bce59", "2895dfbfb1600f0a57f73abfde7637366b032c97", "21548fd7dca2e2eaf8bf2586a376edc7bb0585f8", "e5a82483b5413c5815252db445178890df0bf556", "c3acde55fb6f9c0e6246c2e28e3fca2e74c85fc2"], "outCitations": ["577f24a528b65786cbb4acf50b6480b55c7d433d", "2086fe71a443512cd7efe50828fef81be59fe719", "70ef29e6f0ce082bb8a47fd85b9bfb7cc0f20c93", "388953f99fc8da2a45638229bbd691d4008bb16c", "7d818059870ac7bb60d8bd054c14bb42e8d06704", "1635beefd74dd7d94f4a4f2d49a3169ea7b07351", "bd2eb55d5c497b4a02b992bab4e4e0ec289a2e95", "0dfb77e44c85d97c50607eed06ebb47d194d1bf2", "c4532e9fb167116e5e6d5964d8a46cf44392dcf1", "ccc636a980fa307262aef569667a5bcf568e32af", "2a90c0588d1bf00e349abbb00dde009b6760866a", "4f07eeb29189d1959af58c7c751e7a864b8f0b5a"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/acd9503a9097f091e61f715a4cf003f9acdcb3f6", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://cs.york.ac.uk/rts/static/papers/R:Bartlett:2010b.pdf", "http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2010.68", "http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/aig/papers/Bartlett_2010b.pdf"], "venue": "2010 Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalName": "2010 Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "417-423", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2010.68", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2010.68", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2163733864", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Based on the H\u221e control approach, the robust controller is employed to efficiently suppress the influence of approximation error between the ideal sliding mode controller and the RCMAC, so that the robust tracking performance of the system can be guaranteed.

{"id": "00cf16e5bc01d0c59b0b6f6667618191694f61e8", "title": "Mean Field Inference in Dependency Networks: An Empirical Study", "text": "Dependency networks are a compelling alternative to Bayesian networks for learning joint probability distributions from data and using them to compute probabilities. A dependency network consists of a set of conditional probability distributions, each representing the probability of a single variable given its Markov blanket. Running Gibbs sampling with these conditional distributions produces a joint distribution that can be used to answer queries, but suffers from the traditional slowness of sampling-based inference. In this paper, we observe that the mean field update equation can be applied to dependency networks, even though the conditional probability distributions may be inconsistent with each other. In experiments with learning and inference on 12 datasets, we demonstrate that mean field inference in dependency networks offers similar accuracy to Gibbs sampling but with orders of magnitude improvements in speed. Compared to Bayesian networks learned on the same data, dependency networks offer higher accuracy at greater amounts of evidence. Furthermore, mean field inference is consistently more accurate in dependency networks than in Bayesian networks learned on the same data.", "authors": [{"name": "Daniel  Lowd", "ids": ["3021654"]}, {"name": "Arash  Shamaei", "ids": ["3315549"]}], "inCitations": ["fbf56c149ef3e84c70667ae88ccc967616c4c5ae", "0b5f83ef053ce253f3cbc98bab44f62d96600359", "7e66339668a887f8c657b2fdd59008e5c9997616", "604d105464a5dbb49a059dd54a43b41cdf2e466b", "48c3cb0e17f48a5bb75fd7419365023a49c87584", "ae12e4ee8065c073bec924149afa7931df9262b2", "b9a5706fea427466f243b527a0e83d695c493de7", "e751cd2221df185417cb409409afd5122682fa92", "41810ab6128bef11fbd93acc227f9b835c387539"], "outCitations": ["30afca3a4056bc54deadc1c5794048436d1c9eb4", "d0a9b181fc252108de45720d4645ac245e1ba463", "95101c70ee536ca5e86210999cb16f2614811449", "08c370eb9ba13bfb836349e7f3ea428be4697818", "bc4d9febd19e30f376e4d26deeeb75047bde24d4", "d11f928985cead1276cfebb057a60de34b5a8c17", "19908640236767427ebf0524dc3a4bb09d65145e", "3fbcff06339605696423609c0f3c02737c9e91e4", "937c3e93a15cc416af330f9fcbcf447f7ad77e1e", "2086fe71a443512cd7efe50828fef81be59fe719", "5f8aaefa3c07563cb11884f3f227bd94431544ff", "06e506a71a6dc8b41a92f079795835b45632d052", "9f7e689a465ac321ce607427d86dd17163c12bc4", "eb42a490cf4f186d3383c92963817d100afd81e2", "70ef29e6f0ce082bb8a47fd85b9bfb7cc0f20c93", "3f1bb45d5d20c107daa9dbc489019cf22a3a6e6b", "f8af081e45cd09d510e6701f008d59408e234188", "a6b80923dd30f920234a1ac965bea768062882f8", "76eabcff1a335bbea8c5a56bf050d58944bbac13", "5a802ebd39c70f52dc180eca5d0a7fa4f6b73bbe", "1406b6d771c270aff4dcb1c96e4f5c62c02c00a5", "548150529835fdb6cb3c8a97b6a5631dff569fd3"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/00cf16e5bc01d0c59b0b6f6667618191694f61e8", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/view/3790", "http://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~lowd/aaai11lowd.pdf", "https://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~lowd/aaai11lowd.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/download/3790/3919"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "404-410", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2130186218", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Initially, a self-developed color optical sensing module and a colorimeter were used to measure the colors of LED pixels. After the color matching functions from the collected data was corrected by least-squares approximation method, the calibrated measured sensing module was applied to inspect the color characteristics of LED modules. And the chrominance and luminance data are well analyzed to perform a white light chrominance correction and luminance uniformity compensation for LED display modules. Some 2R1G1B LED modules (16\u00d716 LEDs) from a local industry were verified in this study. The experimental results from the central 8\u00d78 LEDs show that the average color difference of a target D65 white light with a chrominance of (0.1978, 0.4683) by using a 2R1G1B LED module is about 0.027006 before compensation, but the average color difference can be reduced to 0.003474 after it was compensated by using the proposed method.

Elderly tend to lead an isolated life away from their offspring; however, they may fear being unable to obtain help if they are injured or ill. During the last decades, this fear has generated research attempts to find assistive technologies for making living of elderly people at homes easier and independent, as is the aim of this research work. Research study proposes a generalized approach to an intelligent and ubiquitous care system to recognize a few of the most common and important health problems of the elderly, which can be detected by analyzing their movement. In the event that the system was to recognize a health problem, it would automatically notify a physician with an included explanation of the automatic diagnosis. It is two-step approach; in the first step it classifies person's activities into five activities: fall, unconscious fall, walking, standing/sitting, lying down/lying. In the second step, it classifies walking patterns into five different health states; one healthy and four unhealthy: hemiplegia (usually the result of stroke), Parkinson\u2019s disease, leg pain and back pain. Moreover, since elderly having these health problems are less stable and more prone to falls, recognizing them leads not only to detection but indirectly also to prevention of falls of elderly people. In the initial approach movement of the user is captured with the motion capture system, which consists of the tags attached to the body, whose coordinates are acquired by the sensors situated in the apartment. In the current approach wearable inertial sensors are used, allowing monitoring inside or outside of the buildings. Output timeseries of coordinates are modeled with the proposed data mining approach to recognize the specific health problem. Related work. In the related work, motion capturing is done with inertial sensors (Bourke et al, 2006), computer", "authors": [{"name": "Bogdan  Pogorelc", "ids": ["2542780"]}], "inCitations": ["7e54ebd0f6a0843f31fcd0d0e68dbe1e3040bf16"], "outCitations": ["fc24b3e7fd880a06d579473b1d6b141ca5af1f87", "657dcaead090ce7ae0c84df19cfb781a8d933ee9", "05bd06f95c04f2574c4f0a91bf1c3404fec9e383", "85d79297a54b2e0ff144f396045b7c7ae7d89b84", "d1d54e76ef95a41ceaad0763b74da174ea694c73", "e11192a936c0e0b6696056aac49dc7ddafac37b7", "bb1a6eecf04bc0f58976fbadfc405ee3ba8ecb5f", "d1f861ae110c7abd729c9096cc8c802fec2890fb", "c85ad3093bdbcf377dc1128bf6dc6f558383d16c", "28787b6fe0802cc882c98b12f86ba8a67bc3ab53"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a2945e10a826c490867d2b4b2c8d674b5bd6af63", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/view/3580", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/download/3580/4122"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1808-1809", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2404380348", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

The real-time requirements can be met by implementation of appropriate image processing algorithms in hardware. Being one of the most important applications of optical sensors, vision-based vehicle detection and shape recognition for collecting information about road congestion, for driver assistance and for providing information for future development of roads has received considerable attention over the last one-two decades. There are many reasons for the intense research in this field including security requirements in the countries, the increased number of road accidents, the increased number of vehicles on the roads and the availability of feasible computer technologies that has brought a tremendous progress for computer vision research.

A conventional approach to video hashing is to apply image hashing techniques to either every frame or to the selected key frames of a video sequence. Both approaches ignore the temporal information contained in a video sequence. This study proposes an approach for generating representative images of a video sequence that carry the temporal as well as the spatial information. These images are denoted as TIRIs, Temporally Informative Representative Images. Performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated by applying a simple image hashing technique on TIRIs of a video database. It is shown that the resulted video hashing algorithm is highly robust to noise, frame dropping, changes in brightness and contrast, as well as a range of geometric attacks. An average true positive rate of 99.2% and false positive rate of 0.4% of the proposed approach demonstrate the robustness and uniqueness of the generated hashes. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach is easy to implement and computationally more efficient than another state-of-the-art video hashing method.", "authors": [{"name": "Mani  Malekesmaeili", "ids": ["3142420"]}, {"name": "Mehrdad  Fatourechi", "ids": ["2270386"]}, {"name": "Rabab Kreidieh Ward", "ids": ["39079344"]}], "inCitations": ["e253df48ba5f1162db22f6eac702331a8235992e", "dc41eaba7857a9cbd3ae1aebda1a9f515e67004b", "9a37b4925649e99a80f0f5a14271cf1d0a2378e5", "4f96d72ae79ddf43d1511b6c43af373fbc5d15b5", "5bb507f5d6aaa20bc8fdfd0de0b4c74e805e3986", "4cb361553d6e48a7bfa01bfca89a977e6d1c2f71", "f040e310398a1a718389eb738edf8699c76fe028", "f24d1e8c3726a5399c8f14ec48f1ded8648a0b62", "4bf92b0633c4758fba283ea1469e4693b1f094f7", "d2f90e2dc14967efd75be6629fda8a1fdf659311", "08b9ea1496f4f16a853f3fd727f56cbb3fd61e69", "26a3142792c0f219e3ac0d119b8b29eb44ac01db", "e41f978db8852c2f857e53c0b980f6f29ddaa57b", "24e26c495b1220ff1368789adad4f734bf500bc1", "21ec529f38d145cac0fb42112c2072a7dabaf107", "f360a043603e1361414d1f32b7a2997f30dc38d1", "2bc3fbc3f2f649acacd81e8f1a470acc51790d67", "c06f4b705b901e2374e03ae6934c47f1592cb461", "6f0941e7f35cfb7172204bdd6ff0352b3f42a27e", "31e6cc8a7ea24c5e8004e7077ac6b624fa3571c5", "3a691c376e51ac23e8c19f48207a10abdac3688e", "b4479fb67b54413d038c8105784b1545a1c51eec", "a4bb05c73e7f3553ad82ca34beda8d027997db4b", "7a1e8c57ff8c835d7a02f9f7d60c105a9172fd71", "40c938c80754ba5f71aeafef81f386e18cc44406", "c1e74ad45a2ada3c3810231d57bafe65480ea08a", "3257103b0dd89a2c0aefebc0ecafeda4d5562fe3", "6e038c63fab3f36c3a3dac4fbe34a1c0f944670e", "c89b54e5c5a31c7963c61273f431f0f643b21227", "224d519b6ef967af1905f56405071dd0bb6beee5", "c822833f1f8e95dbfbc73d32f14f8f4746810cfb", "32e002b4b6c778bde7600730c9df34ca4f3dcc64", "fa78041c1de9b70f4fe4b1928322cf504ce4b44e", "790b2b5ec00d8fd801e0f4423521afb3293e1bc6", "7b4f68e227999da8ffc6dc9f7fd34da5ebaad09f", "ba4497b6118930eeebf2b063640505523d28618a", "fd8b43fb5e7effc4c507fa8c56ab74a6ae9739ef", "4710340b7b71b76027a0fc3a09a814ce3330f904"], "outCitations": ["3ba3fb2a9da4101dfe6f7dd70bb4bcb1007dad00", "304d4b49ecc161caa9b9a38ec9b456fa32975070", "4e94555d04e3eea1117a1329719a82340eed6476", "10a57cfadc0616dba201cea47177d92e0c99fb9e", "95fbdf6d50e22a776edc50dd2f2b9f5dd466f3de", "3caeceb8cf0494b0a013c3db582f8dc55da30339", "8247475c9bdc88bb45dd237aaf368517334979cb", "83721103a6fd5535e943b1b575cf70862c2322a8", "6818668fb895d95861a2eb9673ddc3a41e27b3b3", "eb34327261eb31e00a6f9496c71b8f28a3df0939"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e8fd2d57bbd5cc3eb6ea98d14644f82342a152ef", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://ipl.ece.ubc.ca/speech_files/C3.pdf", "http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2009.32"], "venue": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalName": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "69-74", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2009.32", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2009.32", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2138476053", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

These weights in the discriminant function are optimized by subspace-based support vector machines (SS-SVMs) so that the margin between classes is maximized while minimizing the classification error. Thus, we can weight the subspaces for each class from the standpoint of class separability. Then, the computational cost of the model selection of MNSMs is lower than that of SS-SVMs because for SS-SVMs two hyper-parameters, which are the kernel parameter and the margin parameter, must be chosen before training. We show the advantages of the proposed method by computer experiments with benchmark data sets.", "authors": [{"name": "Takuya  Kitamura", "ids": ["1688079"]}, {"name": "Shigeo  Abe", "ids": ["40089429"]}, {"name": "Yusuke  Tanaka", "ids": ["3293115"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["2cc26eabbd19841ceb7a13561d4b42f6f1b0a6b5", "03e8d6373b63bb15e11d3092477c55c74c063b72", "725cd02f9ab4e5e4f7db6ef0d2ff5b13819a6fc1", "b6a3e0028d99439ce2741d0e147b6e9a34bc4267", "afd720d55f38506604af3185b6b0b8ffbd75b36e", "626a5da1bfc0f4b38be27f867f95daa061655f94", "f330f5db8c29699fa563f56121570a96e1c191ff", "89b468ea1e2d343873105da71b60beb541202f8c", "6417a4595909d60cec57c29df59be2bfb10ee153", "f28ef9a542ac4286fa5b71b1342dcb4ffa3a372f", "2b238873bff7cc106fe1e3ba64ac519a820548a5", "2a5985e4e237535df0d1b7fd121e86d25842f0bb", "3f600e6c6cf93e78c9e6e690443d6d22c4bf18b9", "718c68c25886484c922d6d33702a726cdd27ca3a", "545c582f20bb3c2399530e5d88880d18be3d481e"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/47c66abd137deaef079a7b69a948203eec33d1ad", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2011.100"], "venue": "2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops", "journalName": "2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops", "journalVolume": "1", "journalPages": "358-363", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2011.100", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2011.100", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2083729385", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

With high-resolution remote sensing images developed, especially in urban area, shadow detection plays a much more important role in many applications.

In our method, we extracted MSER (Maximally Stable Extremal Regions) in the image. Then these regions are classified into shadow-areas and non-shadow areas. Our method is experimentally verified by applying it to Quickbird images.

While it is estimated that insects pollinate at least two-thirds of the all food consumed by humans, malaria, a disease transmitted by the female mosquito of the Anopheles genus, kills approximately one million people per year. Due to the importance of insects to humans, researchers have developed an arsenal of mechanical, chemical, biological and educational tools to help mitigate insects' harmful effects, and to enhance their beneficial effects. However, the efficiency of such tools depends on knowing the time and location of migrations/infestations/population as early as possible. Insect detection and counting is typically performed by means of traps, usually \"sticky traps\", which are regularly collected and manually analyzed. The main problem is that this procedure is expensive in terms of materials and human time, and creates a lag between the time the trap is placed and inspected. This lag may only be a week, but in the case of say, mosquitoes or sand flies, this can be more than half their adult life span. We are developing an inexpensive optical sensor that uses a laser beam to detect, count and ultimately classify flying insects from distance. Our objective is to use classification techniques to provide accurate real-time counts of disease vectors down to the species/sex level. This information can be used by public health workers, government and non-government organizations to plan the optimal intervention strategies in the face of limited resources. In this work, we present some preliminary results of our research, conducted with three insect species.

To test the hypothesis, we trained a BN and SVM model for 2 year survival on 322 lung cancer patients and compared their performance in three separate external datasets (35, 47, 33 patients), each with their own characteristics in terms of missing data. The models used tumor size, clinical T and N stage, involved lymph nodes and WHO performance as prognostic features. We found that the BN model performed better than SVM (AUC 0.77, 0.72. 0.70 vs. 0.71, 0.68, 0.69), especially if tumor size was missing.

Internet-based interventions can be an effective tool for patients\u2019 education and have been shown to positively impact patients\u2019 health outcomes. Focusing on the process leading from Internet usage to health outcomes, this paper reports a model-driven evaluation of a specific Internet-based intervention for patients affected by fibromyalgia syndrome. The evaluation is based on a cross-sectional survey of 209 fibromyalgia patients who were involved in the Internet intervention. Analyses were conducted using a structural equation modeling approach. The analysis mostly confirms the assumed theoretical model with minor and theoretically sound modifications. Results show that the usage of certain tools of the application impacts patients\u2019 health knowledge, which in turn impacts self-management. Improvements in self-management ultimately lower the impact of fibromyalgia syndrome.

Combined with the deficiency analysis of particle filter, an improved particle filter based on diversity guidance is proposed. Firstly, the adaptive resampling step in particle filter is tuned based on two diversity measures which are effective sample size and population diversity factor. Moreover, the operation of particle mutation after resampling is integrated into PF so as to assure the diversity of particle sets. Then, a hybrid proposal distribution is adopted to consider current information of the latest observed measurement. At the same time, annealing parameter is utilized to control the proportional of priori function and likelihood function.

Then, various correction stages are performed where parts of the dictionary are shown to the user for verification and additional information in the form of emotion polarity and probability information are assigned. Using the proposed algorithm with a set of 549 seed words, an emotion dictionary containing over 13,000 WordNet senses was created in just under 7 person-hours of time. To evaluate the created dictionary its usefulness in improving the performance of affect and sentiment classification was examined.

Computing the (minimal) treewidth is NP-complete, so stochastic algorithms are sometimes used to find low width tree decompositions. A common approach for finding good decompositions is iteratively executing a greedy triangulation algorithm (e.g. minfill) with randomized tie-breaking. However, utilizing a stochastic algorithm as part of the inference task introduces a new problem - namely, deciding how long the stochastic algorithm should be allowed to execute before performing inference on the best tree decomposition found so far. We refer to this dilemma as the Stopping Problem and formalize it in terms of the total time needed to answer a probabilistic query. We propose a rule for discontinuing the search for improved decompositions and demonstrate the benefit (in terms of time saved) of applying this rule to Bayes and Markov network instances.", "authors": [{"name": "Andrew  Gelfand", "ids": ["145515598"]}, {"name": "Kalev  Kask", "ids": ["1770755"]}, {"name": "Rina  Dechter", "ids": ["1751239"]}], "inCitations": ["f3025164d44e802c20e84f35aee97ce33057f9dc", "e4d97e1d1120e2126e7c6c6cb2894fa1ebe6f27c", "f5bd87a41557f32c12f0e36d5af623bde24396b8"], "outCitations": ["8c40b93ca769f25a99c38d9de812a2c86d212052", "bb1165624c3974f058fdc0303bbce83f3336543b", "0de6e9beaa984d31a34b5f230d2398e14cbe5aeb", "23e2f84886b98cf04f483fd5f80029c518270462", "318e314579892be0669a76a2f4ab69b32ed11c2d", "90fd6d6198178ebc453edec611d8178a4649e856", "f298ea31480136e1b254ffd397b7c0824f7b7078", "866f2a08aeb5b20517a39546522623dad03228c8", "656f4417b8651f472c6faa370823c307056ffa48", "0a3767909649cf31d32e087693d93171af28ebe0", "ea2839fa1110f44c54b2a310990234d2a16fa600", "1b7ec20ab79bfba7281af130bbcc1741506eef4b", "81cca1dd2b63883a3129ff2175e77f9ad73a2aaf"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/967a465713ae29051ae80ffafcc947e59b9ce479", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/download/3654/3996", "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~agelfand/pub/StoppingCriteria.pdf", "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dechter/publications/r180.pdf", "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~csp/r180.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/view/3654"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1043-1048", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2202897749", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

With interactive narratives, the human author is not present at run-time. Thus authoring interactive narratives is often a process of anticipating user actions in different contexts and using computational mechanisms and data structures for responding to the participant. Generative approaches to interactive narrative, in which an automated narrative generation system assumes some of the authoring responsibility, further decouple the human designer from the participants experience. We describe a general mechanism, called author goals, which can be used by human authors to assert authorial intent over generative narrative systems.", "authors": [{"name": "Mark O.

Traditionally, on-line new event detection system determines whether the incoming document contains a new event based on the history of all processed documents. With the improvement of processed documents, the efficiency of on-line new event detection will decrease. In this paper, we apply a time window strategy to new event detection. A group of new incoming documents in the time window are firstly clustered to obtain candidate topics. Next, these candidate topics are compared with the previously identified topics to determine whether a new topic is detected. The first story of the new detected topic, in temporal order, is regarded as a new event. By analyzing the news story documents within the time window in group, the new event detection efficiency is improved. Furthermore, the evaluations show that the time window processing strategy is helpful to improve the accuracy of new event detection.", "authors": [{"name": "Ruifeng  Xu", "ids": ["1753529"]}, {"name": "Wei-Hua  Peng", "ids": ["49161576"]}, {"name": "Jun  Xu", "ids": ["47882888"]}, {"name": "Xiao  Long", "ids": ["144953932"]}], "inCitations": ["e9aa6b08b99c9795f874c2c7de861eb8b289622b", "c651e4febd426c5cc692cbb99ae181bf4f5efb2f", "f7bd9c628940c3981b70d13153b11f5b4bc434bd", "e1a02e26ffdf86f6693ca8687ae9121998ffb76d", "d513d05dffbb83dbe4d3a2f9d221eb81323e3466", "757fdec4199c9b14203bfd56c724bb87f5fd50bc", "f34aebada6be655825141830aebb6a64e4b77a17", "29d39a058df0d50de7ea27495936c668ca3a4537", "5c813a2b4e675bb85a9876ea0e69b9dc6e460ffb"], "outCitations": ["e0bcc6467b13a7971ee72d8eee49011121006e73", "f09c325c7e407899a926e22bc3238efa1f531bfd", "0ee6f08cd730930a352fe55c0f34e54d1a536c1d", "1f6d01ef34598aaf7028545e6cf4404dfb413697", "0229c0eb39efed90db6691469daf0bb7244cf649", "3792849605e6000c07f924cedef5c2b38611fe6d", "4e77766a0feec71599733bab23573916a321ed3b", "8c84e79451d4b006f64265270f96773e468343f6", "24695229ad22c861c86c9e608111941a5e5fb065", "40d44fad89f4c49cf898766b7808185ba4a5a1c9", "3f2f6772d96d972e3b2da5aaa8a0f2feefdf827f", "852217e9a3ba6a669a2837d8ab407ae06f5ebb48", "5aa11ed499c783c2b31b85db19faac37b884f493", "a0a3ac06d4e4b0ef1cd2354417f4f83bc0997131"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/699b6d45b320cd0b1222d9ddebe9dd4fefd9bcb9", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016957"], "venue": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "4", "journalPages": "1932-1937", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016957", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016957", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2122937222", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

The new method is expected to outperform the existing strategies based on the following two improvements.

This paper investigates the interference of relevance measurement of a topic caused by another topic. For example, consider that two user groups are required to judge whether a topic q is relevant to a document d, and q is presented together with another topic (referred to as a companion topic). If different companion topics are used for different groups, interestingly different relevance probabilities of q given d can be reached. In this paper, we present empirical results showing that the relevance of a topic to a document is greatly affected by the companion topic\u2019s relevance to the same document, and the extent of the impact differs with respect to different companion topics. We further analyse the phenomenon from classical and quantum-like interference perspectives, and connect the phenomenon to nonreality and contextuality in quantum mechanics. We demonstrate that quantum like model fits in the empirical data, could be potentially used for predicting the relevance when interference exists.", "authors": [{"name": "Jun  Wang", "ids": ["40362374"]}, {"name": "Dawei  Song", "ids": ["48437245"]}, {"name": "Peng  Zhang", "ids": ["33623312"]}, {"name": "Yuexian  Hou", "ids": ["1785922"]}, {"name": "Peter  Bruza", "ids": ["1755431"]}], "inCitations": ["3ba1f91f8b5f0f1be304b8d9d8f2fa302c3f8bc0", "20d1e617dc999eb5b3b11a628a38cefed6db61f6", "e8ca0e33b4389f02cd1ab9858096731ce4587421", "fdf19efde29e2d9d467f6bc13c03ccaaddeca058", "cd4599b7eb4cd15d00553f3dbf4f33fefdfc73ff", "9fb8540965e91f35e6727291d9d6f2792001d8c2"], "outCitations": ["693f0a76f24a2cfe1b7b151a772f6292eee61672", "c182981612f46e8738d3c6717579e5204f05acb9", "3750bdd718e75ac25151c321a3ee8ad7236406d5", "113d4364307227830e7d75f076eb06d2c681c5a3", "034e44db4924bd7568b56c8babd65e755c406791", "a3120d5f4d5f6ac6954a09a835d0d44ac8f5476b", "940b60c92f74786e1fdb799f642c0812381b15c9", "745c020a6e25fc650cc0b2d05518caff5e5864fd", "200a6cabc61269089302d3b8544d043172a0b018", "f8c680e4f7be9c52ae40a7fd54258f0ea5565f6f", "7db2adabd65d4d819f920bb94ecb425f96184cd0", "c61e74e17e556446fe2f18345ad0672a686ee91f", "8ccad4d7d9e9a813cfdcd694d3ab36f1c941e9dc", "da46b6bda3e7480b1a8ed68aa81f881e028e809f", "ba584fe4c6d64a36ca0cc4dca97ee2b3100d5e35", "e8e2c9fa1a0946c4c4fe81d906b2a086599f1275", "4808fcf981504158e54f935b9cdba5ea5c330110", "620cc1039e8f4fa95b0dbd5bc11d99970c0c3e58", "ef5b7bb64b8535af43bde9d9e112aee9d8b8bf98", "b802858f3abf4a4471f0f8a769ba5b8f84f339fb", "c3e7b8c26e7915137e15e09f966166082b4f5649", "99614334a3e9b809e43384777409af7eccde3db6", "506f11b1ed48209ac71def88e846d8119f7f7262", "f88c8155fadec829de25c66d71e5f2f955bdf4d8", "91c76875f9db5d3341aca94bfdc4048ebd8d938a"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6f24fd0968e3c2ade6fb9d769ab8b2f237e79a00", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FSS/FSS10/paper/view/2257", "http://www.comp.rgu.ac.uk/staff/ds/papers/Wang-etal-QI2010b.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI Fall Symposium: Quantum Informatics for Cognitive, Social, and Semantic Processes", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "3004058001", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Inconsistencies cause the system to favor alternative explanations and thereby change its beliefs.

The greatest challenge in developing such a framework is the variation in parameters across subjects which is termed as subject based variability. Spectral and amplitude variations in surface myoelectric signals (SEMG) are analyzed to determine the fatigue state of a muscle. But variations in the spectrum and magnitude of myoelectric signals across subjects cause variations in both marginal and conditional probability distributions in the features extracted across subjects, making it difficult to model the signal for any automated signal classification. However we observe that the manifold of the multidimensional SEMG data have an inherent similarity as the physiological state moves from no fatigue to fatigue state. In this paper we exploit this specific feature of the SEMG data and propose a domain adaptation technique that is based on intrinsic manifold of the data preserved in a low dimensional space, thus reducing the marginal probability differences between the subjects, followed by an instance selection methodology, based on similar conditional probabilities in the mapped domain. The proposed method provides significant improvement in subject independent accuracies compared to cases without any domain adaptation methods and also compared to other state-of-the-art domain adaptation methodologies.", "authors": [{"name": "Rita  Chattopadhyay", "ids": ["2518628"]}, {"name": "Narayanan Chatapuram Krishnan", "ids": ["2503137"]}, {"name": "Sethuraman  Panchanathan", "ids": ["1743991"]}], "inCitations": ["e839bc6771d47c88a740d300da576f511890b97e", "d621f08077f797dd5323e42d5d40646af604900c", "d2199720f3e5f84c047c0e966db356dfa6332bdc", "c93f364f79fda285833271cf0074d9ac56f189d9", "2d36db199f189af84c10e53908d959e918679299", "20be936439c626c11611ce62771e8b8ba3c797f9", "00b275680fe3507df7895d25fe477f545c538e7d", "f37484456e915322d59921f49ec3a8172f20564b", "ff82825a04a654ca70e6d460c8d88080ee4a7fcc", "e24876e5b81381415eb39f2ee8655c1ea732b1ef", "b9f1a54aae2169bf7f0a650b3dab243009e2dc37", "45431ddf66be167fb3d161375e5a77dc5667512b", "39c94b561609d138dd6000f5be36ccce75614456", "e03f69bad7e6537794a50a99da807c9df4ff5186", "fe53d772352a2e432d331a4c642211eb2285db54", "5896d1a030368487e6dd1213c65b9ad7fbcca992", "351ef70c0e4d15dec13c961419edbc6c384a538d", "26809a5eadf88a954b7db4140eeda6009a99c667", "35200c6f589c5d71353fb1212fbbf050832b4d94", "1b1893d3ee132a58336465810c6d01200653af72", "2f03b36a6e8077701da8fa58c46613bd08b707f4", "1bc9c040ded21a9968efaf74bd9eee24fb320a48", "554b709ac8e5848f0d7fc1ac4f52903eb76215fe", "c1cd4c408b54ae356fbbd15a2ab2ab368e05d73d"], "outCitations": ["32024f9a00f8659a0a25f72796b0d84d40159c7e", "933c828ff38e897953e1c262ab498aa9779a8bca", "ffa6785fac6cafc60b26be31a8235ba573b4aca3", "f3571b08ce6ffbb485bb6501a07b12b093c5d7bf", "a458fe420d97c355f088e35847c7c1c3bffe7212", "dbc4e0ea1c576b8618aeae6c3608d4645f976c34", "af8835c8960e539cc33f5375861efaedec1fb0b2", "fc5ae1379498daf35c7fcc6f205119d6ea1ba792", "9f8d8674ecd21c8b54deaa69c5fa4088498f5f5f", "53257d6a463c46470dc125935b8d1d3a6d40dafc", "1fc971fc394fd7a00922b082973568850e77a163", "0e32ff526eac54a048aca75d08c750a37c8fc491", "85756d00c94ca78454f39a539bcb1dd9b3ef691a", "abf805ce186d86e900c704c6920da89e590aa854", "cebbd6e489d03410ff178ffe2efce3451ea28790", "11366c5b78dc8c755e43f98035ac28e24d5d4ace", "db8dbe07af7eebc1eed662be268592f00f4882e0", "235723a15c86c369c99a42e7b666dfe156ad2cba", "1dae4d61cd74cc919ecc638bde6b7125728ea97b", "3537fcd0ff99a3b3cb3d279012df826358420556"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/881d78226a8e05bb4cad13d4e833f5a73a61eb77", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS11/paper/view/2395", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS11/paper/download/2395/2907"], "venue": "AAAI Spring Symposium: Computational Physiology", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "4-9", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2279908671", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

But when the semester is over, the vast majority of our students are unlikely to see robots in the classroom again until they take advanced courses in AI or Robotics. It is time for those of us who are proponents of the use of robots in Introductory Computer Science to start thinking seriously about how we are using robots in our classes, and how to sustain the interest and enthusiasm of our students as they move on to more traditional courses. While the focus of this paper is on the use of robots in Introductory Computer Science courses, my goal is to initiate a more general discussion on the use of any sort of cool new technology (tangible or not) into both undergraduate and K-12 education. These technologies successfully attract students to study subjects that we ourselves are deeply engaged in. But we need to discuss as a community what happens when our individual classes conclude and the rest of their studies commence.", "authors": [{"name": "Jennifer S.

A novel strategy of tweet selection is presented, ensuring the chosen tweets are both correct and informative. More specifically, the correctness is estimated according to the labeling confidences and agreement of two Conditional Random Fields based labelers, which are trained on the randomly evenly spitted labeled data; while the informativeness is in proportion to the maximum distance between the tweet and the already selected tweets.

In this paper, we proposed a novel hybrid feature reduction method (MSNR&PCA) based on the combination of feature ranking with principle component analysis (PCA). Three feature reduction methods, namely, feature ranking based the value of signal to noise ratio (MSNR), PCA and the proposed hybrid approach (MSNR&PCA), were examined in two gait analysis problems. One gait analysis problem is to differentiate the patients with Neurodegenerative disease from the controls based on the gait data collected by footswitches. The other problem is to discriminate the patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) from controls based on the gait data collected by an accelerometer. Results showed that the proposed MSNR&PCA achieved best classification performance in two gait datasets. In footswitch data, the highest accuracy (81.78%) was obtained using a feature subset with 4 features generated from original 10 features by MSNR&PCA.

Three high frequency ECG noises; muscle contraction, 50 Hz power line interferences and Gaussian noise were examined. Mean square error (MSE) between filtered ECG and clean ECG was used as a reconstruction performance index. Results showed that the first two IMF levels were deleted owing to their noise components, while the other ensemble IMF constituted clean ECG components for ECG reconstruction.

This has been motivated in part by the assumption that the emulation of human rationality by a machine is sufficient for attaining general human-level intelligence. This paper reviews neuroscientific results showing empirical evidence, consistently for over a decade, sustaining that emotion mechanisms in the brain play a fundamental role in decision making processes, as well as in cognitive regulation. Moreover, this role takes place regardless of whether the subject is aware of any emotion. These mechanisms are particularly important in social contexts. Lesions in the pathways supporting these mechanisms provoke serious impairments on social behavior. For instance, subjects with lesions in the pathways between the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala are no longer able to sustain an healthy social live, despite their intact intellectual capabilities.

Green Driver combines client GPS data with real-time traffic light information provided by cities to determine optimal routes in response to driver route requests. Routes are optimized with respect to travel time, with the intention of saving the driver both time and fuel, and rerouting can occur if warranted. During a routing session, client phones communicate with a centralized server that both collects GPS data and processes route requests. All relevant data are anonymized and saved to databases for analysis; statistics are calculated from the aggregate data and fed back to the routing engine to improve future routing. Analyses can also be performed to discern driver trends: where do drivers tend to go, how long do they stay, when and where does traffic congestion occur, and so on. The system uses a number of techniques from the field of artificial intelligence. We apply a variant of A* search for solving the stochastic shortest path problem in order to find optimal driving routes through a network of roads given light-status information. We also use dynamic programming and hidden Markov models to determine the progress of a driver through a network of roads from GPS data and light-status data.

Moreover, humans assume that the learnerhas a wealth of knowledge and skills, which computersdo not always have. Our goal is to develop an electronic student that can be made increasingly capable through research to learn from human tutorial instruction. Initially, we will provide our student with human understandable instruction that is extended with many scaffolding statements that supplement the limited initialcapabilities of the student. Over time, improvements to the system are driven and quantified by the removal of scaffolding instructions that are not consideredto be natural for users to provide humans.

Then the non-linear dynamic models obtained are calibrated with the actual conditions. These developed models will be used for the simulation of flank wear and using control variable such as cutting speed; the flank wear will be controlled.

For a complex biological system with limited observations, one of the daunting tasks is the large number of unknown parameters in the mathematical modeling whose values directly determine the performance of computational modeling. To tackle this problem, we have developed a data-driven global optimization method, nonlinear RANSAC, based on Random Sample Consensus (a.k.a. RANSAC) method, for parameter estimation of nonlinear system models. Conventional RANSAC method is sound and simple, but it is oriented for linear system models. We not only adopt the strengths of RANSAC, but also extend the method for nonlinear systems with outstanding performance. As a specific application example, we have targeted understanding phagocyte transmigration which is involved in the fibrosis process for biomedical device implantation. With well-defined mathematical nonlinear equations of the system, nonlinear RANSAC is performed for the parameter estimation. Moreover, simulations of the system for propagation prediction over the time are conducted under both normal conditions and knock-out conditions. In order to evaluate the general performance of the method, we also applied the method to signalling pathways where mathematical equations which are representing interaction of proteins are generated using ordinary differential equations as a general format, and public data sets for nonlinear regression evaluation are used to assess its performance.", "authors": [{"name": "Mingon  Kang", "ids": ["3288154"]}, {"name": "Jean  Gao", "ids": ["37986976"]}, {"name": "Liping  Tang", "ids": ["46815726"]}], "inCitations": ["816cbee1a692512e57e0ec580c456fc74d70ae70", "9a1538b7e75ad9fd73a5dc47ce389f95d34b7c76", "d351f17ee2e8ade4f922f16d133f8d563fb34636", "ede89cc05504205b310c04c7f450bd6433c62eed", "76a224c89c2378e9c99e44ce4cdb7dbec35a1c97", "3218ef7c1df49815d54ba335fc30640854d88bad"], "outCitations": ["d88eb037bdb8fbaad86d1f899a1df28ac458b6d4", "12be9e9bd400e8662ad9849923ccd27bb98fef38", "278c9a78d4505cfaf6b709df364dbd1206a017c1", "aee3d4306c14879e492c1a0b03f88dc3c8010715", "c0a9bd0208f62ff0953e8f39290426e8484b8d79", "cf3ca25dd5a086be4addfedaf14a1e8ddbdfa9f3", "d6bffb7aeb53f2bc530bb097afe86873a0f75087", "ca5d10a8ac0ac8e0ffffbac8c7ec3b3e5dc45ba3"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4db08b1c3657777cbd43a46a2d126010c8486c0a", "sources": ["Medline", "DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2011.104"], "venue": "2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops", "journalName": "2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops", "journalVolume": "1", "journalPages": "501-504", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2011.104", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2011.104", "pmid": "23227455", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "magId": "2078001962", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Its distinction between word argument and auxiliaries plays an important part in the precision of syntactic analysis, elimination of semantic ambiguities and semantic role labeling. Therefore, the study of categorization frame information became a hot issue in the recent years. With the constant development of machine learning technology, an increasing number of computational methods have been applied to many fields, including text classification, language processing and semantic analysis, etc. This approach is the supplement and breakthrough to the traditional methods of linguistic study. In this paper, Pearson's correlation coefficient, which can reflect the correlative information between two variables, is adopted to analyze the correlation between the frequency and functions of Chinese visual verbs. The result is that word frequency takes on positive correlations with the main functions of the word, though with certain differences in the degree of the correlation.", "authors": [{"name": "Wen-Jie  Wu", "ids": ["122264851"]}, {"name": "Yan  Xu", "ids": ["98271906"]}], "inCitations": ["bb4c471c51faa4f6bb6f093eb9181963df95baa0", "b9abae2a23be87482e57c9ebaf5e2e048050fe16", "2728e6e758b4c6b59b25f3c9ffa080a8f47f2978", "db0bd06e53fa6ff41d40cf73132f3bf43e90b47b", "bc04b0f3bc821486386ccafc7ad93b76c184aa79", "ce8145851d5caba809e094717384413a0d6d4aca", "a312b6e4cec5f5449e7515396b68aa6e3870ff59", "3eec6354347385109a9799c0d11f0c401c4d7bc3", "cef10c510037aef45cb33cebe5ed1f03edfc4fac", "9f6229327e52fefa48e9ef268a22ca2f18ac3fa3", "7503e5a70284012716c01289d5435c6a4170f4ce", "34ab429df00939c5932aff16b146c62a2019e199"], "outCitations": ["ac55c288dd413da0ea7f9ff8e40f1e88b48fc5e5", "dbcee1d823dd3d4b19f393f351551df0f6879805", "e21f7cca6dd37107e24d27618f0ee8b1af77b1ef", "12f03b33b4a916431f32fd3c8bdd885caba1e3ca", "04a17cbd21dd2704df63ff3b715e671b84b101f4", "394cbb284be07679766ce08fe6248d4aba040824", "82fa2f12a62ecb8f19b414edd819f5564076021d", "f340d5f88eb08d6e28fe69df7f4946f08cdaa535"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6d346ab42e8ae4d2389b09cd0edbd018844f3cf3", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580507"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "4", "journalPages": "2042-2046", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580507", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580507", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1971825732", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

As probability theory is widely used to represent uncertainty, an interesting question therefore is whether it is possible to induce a probability distribution when merging belief sets. To this end, we first propose two approaches to inducing a probability distribution on a set of possible worlds, by extending the principle of indifference on possible worlds. We then study how the (in)dependence relations between atoms can influence the probability distribution. We also propose a set of properties to regulate the merging of belief sets when a probability distribution is output. Furthermore, our merging operators satisfy the well known Konieczny and Pino-Perez postulates if we use the set of possible worlds which have the maximal induced probability values. Our study shows that taking an induced probability distribution as a merging result can better reflect uncertainty and inconsistency among the original knowledge bases.", "authors": [{"name": "Jianbing  Ma", "ids": ["34787180"]}, {"name": "Weiru  Liu", "ids": ["39059482"]}, {"name": "Anthony  Hunter", "ids": ["145805588"]}], "inCitations": ["6cfcd384a967b29105aee872da793ab5e771c041", "3368c58f18819ce54c3958e81dc556203834b297", "f7a3b0f51b04ee02bdf6ece5572b3cf83c8705f2", "ec7cfe962928654beb053b279f712e71a569a70d", "ea071e33b0106018b1cd04afbc772783d550f301", "3d7040897e2389836e3b19f79353a0a7b9f2bf62"], "outCitations": ["d501e85fedae98ccda9ce188df60cb32e12fdb29", "b512dff98695c253c5cec965c9487607b8d18503", "199f54a168eb59ab0c301432dad836829f7f0685", "63214ed52bbb8b8e9a0fb8553072231cf7134bb7", "633d262199c71db1fee9c53f25706b4dd4d6ba96", "2e1b6fa71e4bae73654ad3ed845eb778b0f435d1", "78238c06311b29153f37750b0c7fc726a7f8878c", "939bfb9104523975d4a9e32ce48da420ff20158a", "b6f58567e134e11ee2fa8ae9eb088723c1b1bf03", "61d91386ffd2d730f5ca20c0770ee728b60e0fec", "17c9455ec860d88916da24e4b9fd8dedad22ffed"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3158c95e281e848495a2e1d155c96bdc00da3ee9", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1716", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1716/1987", "http://www.cs.qub.ac.uk/~W.Liu/AAAI10Prob.pdf", "http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/a.hunter/papers/aaai10.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "339-344", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1488973897", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Introducing a camera-equipped mini-UAV into this task requires autonomy and information technology that itself is an integrated intelligent system to be used by a sub-team that must be integrated into the overall intelligent system. In this paper, we identify key elements of the integration challenges along two dimensions: (a) attributes of intelligent system and (b) scale, meaning individual or group. We then present component technology that offload or supplement many responsibilities to autonomous systems, and finally describe how autonomy and information are integrated into user interfaces to better support distributed search across time and space.

It is assumed that all such activities are produced from an underlying set of event class generators. The learning task is then to recover this generative process from visual data. A set of event classes is derived from the most likely decomposition of the tracks into a set of labelled events involving subsets of interacting tracks. Interactions between subsets of tracks are modelled as a relational graph structure that captures qualitative spatio-temporal relationships between these tracks. The posterior probability of candidate solutions favours decompositions in which events of the same class have a similar relational structure, together with other measures of well-formedness. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure is used to efficiently search for the MAP solution. This search moves between possible decompositions of the tracks into sets of unlabelled events and at each move adds a close to optimal labelling (for this decomposition) using spectral clustering. Experiments on real data show that the discovered event classes are often semantically meaningful and correspond well with ground-truth event classes assigned by hand.", "authors": [{"name": "Muralikrishna  Sridhar", "ids": ["39159957"]}, {"name": "Anthony G.

In just a single run, the auction is able to extract enough value information from bidders to compute approximate truth-inducing payments. This stands in contrast to current auction designs that need to repeat the allocation computation as many times as there are bidders to achieve incentive compatibility. The auction is formulated as a kernel method, which allows for flexibility in choosing the price structure via a kernel function. Our main result characterizes the extent to which our auction is incentive-compatible in terms of the complexity of the chosen kernel function. Our analysis of the auction's properties is based on novel insights connecting the notion of stability in statistical learning theory to that of universal competitive equilibrium in the auction literature.", "authors": [{"name": "S\u00e9bastien  Lahaie", "ids": ["51909421"]}], "inCitations": ["7d7b77f4a5a77d5071d15aad100660c6a56a4440", "6728c855c1c6052d60f56afb3ffcdc3f76cdb444", "d60d70048979c4aed5683cd0d6d5c2233e1f0984", "2d3bc9961bed84679248d9ad72b7816a9c8eedf1", "eff91a6685f8d4137f406ac97bb29f6488f97bd7", "0cedad88e2a16b0db8079c33d2fed117e90afa4d", "a8cdbb2d41f0945f8038ca7fada0deb018fa1602", "e736abd2791270243b3e4a84d7359f62e2ff28f6", "6298d4b39536fc84f115f3f208bd37c8838887d8", "53b15b8b3d379c256e16eb732153abdb5467967e", "b543d33cd50399b95a28fcdeb8aac8926cdcafb8"], "outCitations": ["4d92838c1357e132987d82ad3c6a426141a7f8cd", "c5a0b3b643aa937809504fb0051d1a926dd3d4ee", "427b168f490b56716f22b129ac93aba5425ea08f", "3bbcc1690e4f36ca2d92c00653b8acf9d14004f5", "1da50ab5981ec34157f65ee797fca32f43ad6952", "82a7e6300c57aeedc5c0763e30c8400669a12a44", "d1274bbd004c12cbf1ac8b7b4ab7c8831e0a1726", "11106aadd1c133477b163f08de6c9436cd5468fe", "59f98fbf6acba04757836ff845b616a806a479d0", "53f2bf254c530c4412a8892896422511bc2cee45", "5057d1e96811e58a98ebeef884b7b81b43e1c61d", "3d05184edc53ce4ada8129ce6cb240b910a4b223", "385197d4c02593e2823c71e4f90a0993b703620e", "80e50ba5af59e33d5c139c22b199b74056a271ae", "cfa8ff2b1b9b873ffe0e4f28120259c2bf803a15", "e7c485b739ef4693401da3871da63546bc8e9540", "0edf25b345da613dc7808991afed58663ba66b83", "d5051890e501117097eeffbd8ded87694f0d8063", "0f6f5df702dcb29d00bec125fbb2269327422153", "fc4c9a3177f53de98f0ebb2d070629d10f646917"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f65566719ed82911e38fbf1d5bbd6be223cb00e9", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/kernelauct.pdf", "http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~nelkadri/CSI5389/Papers/91-Lahaie_AAAI2010.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1921/2094", "http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/167972/kernelauct.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1921"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "811-816", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1496637232", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Personal information holds significant value and web based businesses often seek to monetize that value. Unlocking personal information value in web based businesses, like social networks, can lead to disclosure of private and sensitive information, and subsequent harm. Personal information management business practices are subject to privacy law, but perhaps more importantly practices that protect personal information can be a means to competitive advantage, and as a result they can form the basis of effective business strategy. We explore the underlying tension between transparency and disclosure in the privacy verses business strategy arena, and argue that the next generation of web businesses based on powerful Web 3.0 applications and services will demand a privacy by design approach, rather than addressing privacy concerns as an afterthought.

The approach is based on the weight value system and coalitions, and is applicable not only to the revenue sharing in the closed-loop supply chain, but also to almost all kinds of the revenue sharing. After that, an example of closed-loop supply chain is illustrated to explain the application of the coalition value.", "authors": [{"name": "Weimin  Ma", "ids": ["2735560"]}, {"name": "Zhang  Zhao", "ids": ["47122755"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["746ce36dbc25541aac84fc72ed00bbabad39c6aa", "4790a466efca4e4e9790d09e1cdbde62b420c631", "dc093f1ca286556a13ac4924fc6cd5667f984872", "111cbaa411fc0cb0ab1e04140b87b3375abdc919", "028159d7de18af4dcac8dc580b8145f115ec1fc8", "825eb66e4206edd071087de0a287692b76f76eb0", "09368ccba6d01b1aa2399c0c04a4cbc6bb5e8f02", "ac9b5cb3665ef211c70cb0f8adcf49d50caab584", "16dd0d8aee744a1775f089ac9493a07aa65bd904", "a3a33c787da48c5183af82680556d853cc7d60c0", "3a5a67c51e987b5b7cda680ca7ff96cd4eb2a5d7", "6e0e81969aadbe6d457172354fbf0bb343d0b0f5", "19088a582f2eb657ac1803f1ea1b79058d5c3dc7", "6f62369abdb0d630202e7c17f54995c8ab19afc4", "d4e4c1db66130216d2c5caff85c21da3880b519e", "b31ff5b45dcc7295b85cc39ad62f1243690f748e", "58702f872c3383fa3c2414ff8b5323b7d1140353", "d09058f028bb45685ff8ff38285c92cd6267c85b", "0863dad78bb7ec990884f48d5411d7b126183595", "ab7a59f5145a66a24a330dfe0e0c61a1dd43a532", "1b93b27d4b7e06b916c86bee441775e92cf3fda6", "4cbd26124ad9fad7740793a927e7b28c994860d1", "1f7732ec86193bfb45105466084646666a3adfe4", "1bdfd057bcd034e71fcb10cf71d1b370974403cd", "d8097299650a2e243d5fe388f04c3ea2eb3439c3", "7ab15ef11f12e601a87abc52c27a014417b72237", "24ffb9d3a87f8b55e88c8e2e665a8cb31244b3b9", "5d4ea3f19c9bc72b7e2f8e39c0af9eb456debe9e", "d358e293fd8bb160caa1b4827e38eca2d69aa67e", "1e1ab990acddb1f30a9612d0dc578549591c0173", "f4d5955c53aa8e25edab2dfa7552c7d36e6a1d15", "7f8520e6c41f36cc25fa30397b0e78e9e3758233", "e731ee49b710a60d158804fcbd07daac91e3fc04", "5f482f9525c07e5e7f9a84abf80cebdb852876fc", "b32e8bd27f228f98a4f028fe29ed7e5984a2ec24", "4826162d2af5697e9cdc1c705f1e96816481e90c", "ce93d979e766626cb03c0bce26a63986ea37d2f3", "6bd960c053e14c2736bf176ace515f772e989a59", "edf7ca21d805edc4b37bd304bd6a62897adaf9c3"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6164668c4a62cbe5f02a48c53b1987922998bf78", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.gbv.de/dms/tib-ub-hannover/640153704.pdf", "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580924"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "3", "journalPages": "1141-1146", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580924", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580924", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Business", "Computer Science"], "magId": "2028138635", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

However, it is not a trivial task to detect grammatical errors in oral conversations because of the unavoidable errors of automatic speech recognition systems. To provide corrective feedback, a novel method to detect grammatical errors in speaking performance is proposed. The proposed method consists of two sub-models: the grammaticality-checking model and the error-type classification model. We automatically generate grammatical errors that learners are likely to commit and construct error patterns based on the articulated errors. When a particular speech pattern is recognized, the grammaticality-checking model performs a binary classification based on the similarity between the error patterns and the recognition result using the confidence score. The error-type classification model chooses the error type based on the most similar error pattern and the error frequency extracted from a learner corpus. The grammaticality-checking method largely outperformed the two comparative models by 56.36% and 42.61% in F-score while keeping the false positive rate very low. The error-type classification model exhibited very high performance with a 99.6% accuracy rate. Because high precision and a low false positive rate are important criteria for the language-tutoring setting, the proposed method will be helpful for intelligent computer-assisted language learning systems.", "authors": [{"name": "Sungjin  Lee", "ids": ["1744734"]}, {"name": "Hyungjong  Noh", "ids": ["2806472"]}, {"name": "Kyusong  Lee", "ids": ["2014351"]}, {"name": "Gary Geunbae Lee", "ids": ["1735513"]}], "inCitations": ["5fd6230598795703951c28cc219fe674d516e0e6", "5f404fe90ebdc032ae5b1901d5ca3b073b0874de", "96a5669eecd6826215f90147d1188c333ccaa67e", "0aa2f0adce5d9a9f6d30be4e8c979ce4ddc8d1c2", "467c7778ee18825a609ab7816e3ce9b3091447d9", "187175202f7bae91bcae1ca25213e57d15c78278", "0efc91da605effe85200c9dc753043acc869408c", "e8dee420a988d52d01208c61ef80fca2e1195fba", "a6221b70a367388c8584d78f0e6a681637208c20"], "outCitations": ["399da68d3b97218b6c80262df7963baa89dcc71b", "f7d08c4fdf359f5cf0946a4a86db52d273a59ba4", "9623e17d444445cdaecad4948999acdd9abc6252", "7011839d8ff8f3b554b449aa30c9426074777b48", "ccaef3ed75665d60bdad438e21ce63f1e1c29ec7", "ce183f4660b9bad3249a5efa1b421f04b0b70176", "950a3c89dacbc3e7ddcd43d7ff6f985697e41cdb", "190e3d96815b0e9b16d93eb66127af02fd2f9b9b", "cf53f9a08f56a33d24b61701492e91c1587843b7", "2b6ee984498668a85f2151e5600a7090e92063fa", "cbc1a3552829395da5ecac98ac6c416a3c22dcd2", "0fa9e8494c9d1a21b94584f89bee7e84257e2af9", "273dfbcb68080251f5e9ff38b4413d7bd84b10a1", "128f524a3c43f4f423e9da5015722d8e2fbc5851", "b50a41eb407d3eb5f765f45344e03a94942b4d46", "f302a4558dfc1c538eeb498bea2a172b4c039fab", "a98e481ce418a437cdfae107d85f009a5da6a790"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/036243e37ecbe0baff1257a42d93fbf1108070ba", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/download/3501/3954", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/viewFile/3501/3954", "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/43e37ecbe0baff1257a42d93fbf1108070ba.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/view/3501"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "797-802", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2403346063", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

However, for arbitrary problems, an agent is unlikely to have the perceptual processes necessary to discriminate all relevant states in terms of such an abstraction. \n \nTo help compensate for this, reinforcement learning can be integrated with an imagery system, where simple models of physical processes are applied within a low-level perceptual representation to predict the state resulting from an action. Rather than abstracting the current state, abstraction can be applied to the predicted next state. Formally, it is shown that this integration broadens the class of perceptual abstraction methods that can be used while preserving the underlying problem. Empirically, it is shown that this approach can be used in complex domains, and can be beneficial even when formal requirements are not met.", "authors": [{"name": "Samuel  Wintermute", "ids": ["2123844"]}], "inCitations": ["cf6c64b87459a3164ad54128fa085328c401c09f", "7efb460e042d6c6706b4536ffac83fc891486dae", "b031e2f7312e1d9c09070d5c823ab8c0126b5ad2", "be3bd82d18cabd3ed78105dcaca760fef26f4ac7", "d6ae4ad4bc5f1a56d327f06f65366617464fcfdc", "ba2d90995a7c114a0e03370ae5bfeb677e6657a5", "f82e4ff4f003581330338aaae71f60316e58dd26", "9a18a23dd60237bd56f20725d4a45ee76cd13957", "926eee377968d87d0c8b6a28f68a887b44fa4f81", "76af60b0cae533540ae071cc1cd1c94ed4621188", "c91513ba36c1ff5ed4ebf6a4f9e98a2c93f91d3f", "da7d67f9d3341754942a4c3f5da6eface2adf68e", "8ddc325cb34c671db2faee6929d615bfafdbaed1", "5342ef6f2e894b192ed69a81123b0174ccc26e3e", "dfdc5109167f12b3d482fad5f3f78af49e18e31f", "3689115fa21e16d50030aaec01822af996f3e4e7", "5b419e18cefd5c2b8ee15113f105ef9423dc5e61"], "outCitations": ["df7c6065060953361535afde2511725aac5cee7d", "03a05ebe2f4a78ee08df9c704684207bf178f3c2", "c8abee187fb09be2d53a53b96139899ae9b9f12a", "c3af3b09c4a6e9b1e3cc2f88a5238bbbabe3605d", "f2f864ec8e3259243a0493aac1ae149375022b2f", "2020aca3838a0e8a723761e74899b183d6b56f30", "a6ed036a5523d8356085316116a805a2664d1e2b", "be055f2a2ce2cf7dad8c83c0b23b65c8290d07e6", "e999088241f825045d02bc8bd357cca474b1ea41", "a85faf78df04e14c767f8821610e932bee13456c", "ca9a2d326b9de48c095a6cb5912e1990d2c5ab46", "97efafdb4a3942ab3efba53ded7413199f79c054", "b1362879e77efef96ab552f5cb1198c2a67204d6", "25fd7e9ed8d1a669c7a8d28a8b620479899e6b53", "1fc34cfd82abfe1620c820b033059d0cc44ef4b8"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bd8dc869f71558f862a27421af1ddb70edf5cbd4", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~soar/sitemaker/docs/pubs/wintermute_aaai2010.pdf", "http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/soar/sitemaker/docs/pubs/wintermute_aaai2010.pdf", "http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~swinterm/papers/AAAI10-ReLAI.pdf", "http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/soar/sitemaker/workshop/30/wintermute1.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1767", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1767/2258"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1567-1573", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1542524953", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

For instance, delivery companies might have to coordinate to choose who should serve which foreseen customer, under uncertainty in the locations of the customers. The framework of Distributed Constraint Optimization under Stochastic Uncertainty was proposed to model such problems; in this paper, we generalize this formalism by introducing the concept of evaluation functions that model various optimization criteria. We take the example of three such evaluation functions, expectation, consensus, and robustness, and we adapt and generalize two previous algorithms accordingly. Our experimental results on a class of Vehicle Routing Problems show that incomplete algorithms are not only cheaper than complete ones (in terms of simulated time, Non-Concurrent Constraint Checks, and information exchange), but they are also often able to find the optimal solution. We also show that exchanging more information about the dependencies of their respective cost functions on the sources of uncertainty can help the agents discover higher-quality solutions.", "authors": [{"name": "Thomas  L\u00e9aut\u00e9", "ids": ["2001878"]}, {"name": "Boi  Faltings", "ids": ["1735128"]}], "inCitations": ["3067983a3e5563869ef412268d3d0c45aaa5e95e", "043fcc7bf8a5bf10f7582fd293a761e9a8bf4920", "27582e28112f9a71f7945c702749c3745d0bf8e6", "93df5a04d43d95d116d85a2215435da65d2cc5a1", "76a37ba3050e55ac06ab4721a563e76d01ad014a", "3b640c94d88f942b6f0d8acfbf94ca6cfaff49c3", "754b854c5b935d59d4834e86809cbdecac01d661", "41e1f8fb7f577f4ab50ca289fbeb8689d9559e11", "5e5b5b2f31278953171cdb9b45756308a6dbcef3", "07f2e882b017eb51be94902b0abdfd5131d9f4f4", "0e8b4f1a5fd1958742879ed3132ed8ca2ea38982", "192f38331812e1a4960fc0367af60b488b095f5c", "67ba5739eca95b45dfabba2a557ccb5ee08b50aa", "5ed4bd1184349f4b5e8ad4b3715f5b18fb168942", "a6e663a008da7eeb43b51d905f663f0d58580228", "2b59a1519ef3673ed743071efb4fcc8265a0aadb", "3ae0deef55cf93cc77b4f9300cd8f3962b79a8aa", "fa910371d9581c3ce297e1482e99f33f926b81e2", "4bceb49f96798fa753526bdda9e9131d24c97768", "8ca1965fcf343939abc77570c693de17ffc1eb75", "05ee1ae7c5cce84f8f9da2a6816de3cd34f300db", "318fd8f99fdd60545c4988b7378fe82973110c05", "63f0a4d6c574b80f4695b85f10661c0f4922ca3f", "a86386ac75450f5da0a099e3439e884731de8a4a", "07b5ea8bf289ac14140ebc5dde41a9b477345e1e", "2882dc3ecd97b1027b1aba093f6bc52f83879c0a", "a36bb6791c0fcde059d08c0d1d8a1168a2c4b81a", "de78faef62aa551e7756fee6db993854dab34177", "57a3f77ff82128e9b67628fc073e3d8fc383b0cc", "62e0f2ac4ee0bb63ad7af6ba81fd1780bf902898"], "outCitations": ["7a80d7e77e4d4ea8d493f34b87b01cb19b0130c1", "08368938fbb3df6f6cb566c9cdcc77c35ed79cbb", "9d2f31a264aa282cebec474126c5097c47926d22", "255ab528055d938663ad3274e9437c711e8e5d99", "f9334aa7acbe2a0d7bbc068275f8ffd371124ba4", "603ce4a1dd704de213f28bf1e39e57033e9cf924", "da6b8caf3d1990964d04a6055ac884f4347d9c6b", "099638598045d90b32cadcca1a736abe9081dc62", "9e50c665d7261bfba6146178ce1d5a120f54ed89", "39775860ff0702974844049fca907cf756b98596", "7dd2cc380f2c08891332db59c7a552493d1d0844"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c260cf8f8c6150927c2404b87fcc101f8dd091e0", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://liawww.epfl.ch/Publications/Archive/Leaute2011a.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/download/3430/3818", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/view/3430"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "68-73", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2141256287", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

The methods we focus on are of two types. The first one assumes the universe comes with a preference relation on its elements and attempts to lift that relation to subsets of the universe. That approach has limited expressivity but results in orderings that capture interesting general preference principles. The second method consists of developing formalisms allowing the user to specify \"atomic\" improvements, and generating from them preferences on the powerset of the universe. We show that the particular formalism we propose is expressive enough to capture the lifted preference relations of the first approach, and generalizes propositional CP-nets. We discuss the importance of domain-independent methods for specifying preferences on sets for knowledge representation formalisms, selecting the formalism of argumentation frameworks as an illustrative example.", "authors": [{"name": "Gerhard  Brewka", "ids": ["1681333"]}, {"name": "Miroslaw  Truszczynski", "ids": ["1702808"]}, {"name": "Stefan  Woltran", "ids": ["1743085"]}], "inCitations": ["cbfb0205a96021ed3c6ea921535f0056571bf0b4", "eef2f53f478cc62c74f9e491ce630705a888e5ad", "1a856729fc870ebb65bac354e662aaadcf5588b3", "490a9eccc5ae216132e939d6e80f6f5c5c4cc566", "d37a2e690db8fb265c570d25fff33e68cea39d35", "33517839ca08cf81746d80e0248d7a1128871796", "d065dc8aa2ab48c5dc7f607671a87aa90b0098e7", "5b18ac50a3c883cb40bd7170d6d4a1040e00b902", "fb283d09d1c9572e517f1d9c23042b4cc08c02ee", "01742748db9cad75cda14688bdd72e58ab4416cf", "24f60ce14741a79768a774f78f81fa3d8a8ed248", "41775d8b6de1742fedbb1ec1071faf53b908f3e5", "2281527cb315033bff3ff30bfe4626fc5599f8c5", "92c401de089a053c8dff54661ae9e33862152f23", "e96a54e933fc5b439682860c62edc546ac04ae75", "f0321ebe3e83ef2f32d5ffb2aeeb8dc7ca70f76c", "2cbc47ec35a11bb3d02dc051b68a4f8c64015381", "50cea5400de880e1cb4f4091a562a38b5d82c2cf", "1ef9a7bfe0cd46e3e8fee292079ad8a42dd9ab13", "a6aece38058f39d633cea7429afe00630f868363", "a4c49290084a4eb7849308e6e103298fedd74b54", "a3b08cccd8e75bafd87da30257bb93be18400660", "ce59e432a22d769d406941f862b81da9c5029adb", "cf38d77b654f2c31ac7bcd8bcddb4418bef81d91", "478ac14f055ee64234739e992968f0c5521d2043", "ae8c2fcb0527396ce8205afafde8753cfad01270", "e90fe49e865c8205cf930a8aafa5761980c0c77e", "163fefbe723c0ad53b7a482166eb6f8921e806eb", "6d550556549a8f2bb6532542d845cea37f512367", "b4354c3d0dbe28dc2a9161aa3518555568c113f6", "e8f6fe44e76a540626ef485837aeea12cec8b02d"], "outCitations": ["4482106f56c14d2fdfc8d35eb62ca59339c494a2", "bb8b03403e4da825c0ba5ec8e287233a18b23f9c", "d54c0425c2b9741894f03c51d413e42851bb9169", "a0dd9cf3e2fce3e8ad36200db0dc1e3d7bc5e16c", "349d84b45973c5b5fdaf5b0b567bb128a0e131cc", "f5c9ec494a46d67b8d9080fb96fc3b22c07217b2", "a677f99c435d6b730980b69969ce79298b42bf4b", "f78f54ea4ff4e67e0d980e89d8d9badb1de283f5", "215084aad4b1f925294610b3adeadb3202b133ed", "584e431ff02b4652a5670b1fc516fe8867e363dd", "5207a48f0aa8b26c70fa018ab84b24779a8892b8", "193a0319afa14e6a7c3ff6e5699c979bc6286e29", "be3b7fdca8adaedffddccf01c4bb43b42a901e4f", "6660531786599b4b128f8f1ad626b33fa98da93d", "4873f44543ab09a14c6d3e15314f006517efeed9", "99d6ac2180c500e843a0ba7a0365b3bdc04beee9"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f07d27ca0d4b627b190ed4f0b493cb64633d2d15", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1659/1971", "http://www.cs.uky.edu/ai/papers.dir/btw10.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1659"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "273-278", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1525934073", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

In GMM, each cluster obeys Gaussian distribution and the task of clustering is to group observations into different components through estimating each cluster's own parameters. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm is always involved in such estimation problem. However, many previous studies have shown naturally occurring data may reside on or close to an underlying submanifold. In this paper, we consider the case where the probability distribution is supported on a sub-manifold of the ambient space. We take into account the smoothness of the conditional probability distribution along the geodesics of data manifold. That is, if two observations are \"close\" in intrinsic geometry, their distributions over different Gaussian components are similar. Simply speaking, we introduce a novel method based on manifold structure for data clustering, called Locally Consistent Gaussian Mixture Model (LCGMM). Specifically, we construct a nearest neighbor graph and adopt Kullback-Leibler Divergence as the \"distance\" measurement to regularize the objective function of GMM. Experiments on several data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of such regularization.", "authors": [{"name": "Jialu  Liu", "ids": ["2746747"]}, {"name": "Deng  Cai", "ids": ["1724421"]}, {"name": "Xiaofei  He", "ids": ["3945955"]}], "inCitations": ["972160cc6a2c3a63f6978fb829963f14188b7a3f", "87d9b486605234370944638eda727fa43003e1d0", "abd401a12c62fd4bb45cc9b9978a5a22b4b9769f", "15e53b802edb3035b20a57502fd9afcbcf403809", "04ccafc309026abc785f37ae1a5c70df1df8c385", "76dc710abfdf19bf9c5fe9eba18b0b3f489bfa2b", "2e2c5b1b9f9e81ee46e028a76199e208cd46b13d", "661b7c122aa5e7d275774ef63b9b78a7104a4912", "92eb930f48aa1edbbee85f99d0e82f2e423b4223", "4038647be6d3b619187dd2a053772d8e06fe5134", "a0e81236e8f8f306922df02e35c84ee28b8202ed", "36840612f17136363b950d3b970b13fabfc6022d", "bf7641f802b2d6f46a564f2c06675d0915c6938e", "4e48a0a633c00fa92090bfec47928fc1442b9440", "4a37272cf779184386badd2debca8ed0538a3cdf", "6ed5dc5a4c5f2e8420b62da2f25988ed25f64a14", "403dba2821b4b2164a8e308b63d9c10c9e4c3b1c", "4defc46f04604ef531b8bfb8b36139ed5aae6dc3", "4a80cfff28b51168cb9ac5535e4691a320e0a03e", "3270e5b96ba8df83bb709fdf88b82116a2477b68", "16ce24842301330ad30e903a53ff7f15b23566d9", "6dc66ba9c1d19dc1c2a9bd1bb8aa33e2c370a0a3", "a7177f4192dfdb725f8a5982d12c41098b5aa94b", "4eb130a05b2fc9cad0bd97fd85500a71ad5cbd66", "d04c5abd24d1524f10b5275aa50df80957b068b2", "0e5793a858700ae65d31726a91bd6fd7959b45f9", "3c3cea34d9b1802d39509b1c5fc8d2f5fa1a3a34", "fc64d0135474773921d04b6a6036105afc923829", "a5b28aa120ded833814544114051a519c1497ad3", "4db41be911db50186121f9a88f39b932b7a27046", "c562b46a086c2cd221b997e751bb912b9f70eaf3", "d99f8e922c4a849270fc38e4b99b2414ddfcaa8d", "98533a8ec6870d8f5876dd5c3625c140e36a3e45", "412f3b343065d5db90af576f522561ce0082c72e", "66e016ecd1a2f878a1be663e593b3b1914195be0", "73f27cca91e404de6a511e61da02905c6db61a25", "d580cf2cf9493b67d08fa8b2300f3bbc9ed864b7", "355651687abacc7834a49f280cbc1076f7e96515", "254595220e8ce50d824383dd402794247f349506", "b430871ec2a19e1beddec33fa79d04d07b5b4a34", "83e7b0092565bd1a9321b4b77848cd681f574ea0", "f708482e99ed40a2fb9e363577479e1fd15afc9f", "d554131d0f567779f929c39e3d9329b84f28e792", "5bb0f577e5b2f0bb90a09ba9f98afea1536e724d", "3b3f46087fe645d7a8d06d02d3ff2b31dd0703ba", "5e4fb9b216657cbed1125b3be359ee482168c3e3", "702eeab7164fca800bcdd17a582f136860322ce9", "ca362b19a9c6503bafdf96019f1818959cfa1ff4", "819c5d111e95c31c8949dfbcf061b08a675838bf", "2d9102173556c3268a6e7fa9f5bfab0c84dfa3aa", "2d16c4da966f2fc03d396d5cac9d039e0f7bfb2a"], "outCitations": ["f9cd56e04d4901fbccb092d5773c3b16ecdc5b0d", "b94c7ff9532ab26c3aedbee3988ec4c7a237c173", "afcd6da7637ddeef6715109aca248da7a24b1c65", "81032f72599eae019d6a0812c037c59dd694c23a", "b2746adae0413e87aec01303c2d8a2a67113bf11", "932a106c21a1db1e1876459c1521d27fd152caac", "3537fcd0ff99a3b3cb3d279012df826358420556", "2a47c079016f63a5122285814091d690915f66ce", "71f583f58217531942756757c72588a7d58a0d7b", "8ff7b7cf3849640b7cfb8f08e2946fd151fed34c", "78053512af13466c569e5946acfc3953bbfc9d36", "19bb0dce99466077e9bc5a2ad4941607fc28b40c", "d36efb9ad91e00faa334b549ce989bfae7e2907a", "c02dfd94b11933093c797c362e2f8f6a3b9b8012", "4f2320627a6db302e55600c368e78100ef8e7975", "8017699564136f93af21575810d557dba1ee6fc6", "46770a8e7e2af28f5253e5961f709be74e34c1f6", "851eb4b78f6deb8aba9d39529e462c5319940f51", "e75fceff79fefa063d00ebc56a20c7df5485cf2b", "3bb5a439a0d610a7eac68f73068cdd278b8c9775", "95d6ff6279fa0f92df6fae0e6bd4c259acfc8f09", "9d16c547d15a08091e68c86a99731b14366e3f0d", "8a9371b60edd9517341fc50d6d4de19dfb2a330d"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/185c399ed3222a3e7c82ad2dcd2c560a2aa9da66", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://jialu.info/paper/aaai2010-liu.pdf", "http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~xiaofei/AAAI2010-Liu.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1671", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1671/2028"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "512-517", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1594453127", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

The business rules constraint business structure or control behaviour of a business process. In modern business modelling, one of the important phases is writing business rules. Typically, a business rule analyst has to manually write hundreds of business rules in a natural language (NL) and then manually translate NL specification of all the rules in a particular rule language such as SBVR, or OCL, as required. However, the manual translation of NL rule specification to formal representation as SBVR rule is not only difficult, complex and time consuming but also can result in erroneous business rules. In this paper, we propose an automated approach that automatically translates the NL (such as English) specification of business rules to SBVR (Semantic Business Vocabulary and Rules) rules. The major challenge in NL to SBVR translation was complex semantic analysis of English language. We have used a rule based algorithm for robust semantic analysis of English and generate SBVR rules. Automated generation of SBVR based Business rules can help in improved and efficient constrained business aspects in a typical business modelling.", "authors": [{"name": "Imran Sarwar Bajwa", "ids": ["2798654"]}, {"name": "Mark G.

Metaheuristics included genetic algorithms (GA), covariance matrix self-adaptation evolution strategies (CMSA-ES), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and ant colony optimization (ACO). Results indicate that fitness growth rates for GA were greatly inferior to fitness values for NR, CMSA-ES, PSO, and ACO. For the data sets considered, coefficients determined using CMSA-ES were identical to coefficients generated with NR, while coefficients from PSO- and ACO-based logistic regression were only slightly different. For the ionosphere data with a larger number of features, ACO likelihood fitness growth was slower when compared with CMSA-ES and PSO. Because this was an early investigation of metaheuristics in logistic regression, future studies employing similar metaheuristics should focus on investigation of global vs. local minima.", "authors": [{"name": "Leif E.

In a solar cell module, the surface will affect the overall yield efficiency of power generation. This study utilizes an optical grade Epoxy (EPO-TEK 301\u20132FL) to replace the Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA) for solar cell modules, and to explore the electrical characteristics (IV) of Epoxy-based solar cell modules. In the manufacturing process of Epoxy-based solar cell modules, the effect of controlled parameters such as Epoxy thickness, curing temperature and curing time for module packaging results is studied for optimization of multiple quality of control factor by using the Grey Relational Analysis (GRA).

This paper describes and compares four techniques used for the reduction of search space generation in 2-D simulation and game world environments. In order to improve the computational overheads, reducing size of search space is necessary. The size of search space is related to the number of nodes and edges. A high number of nodes and edges will have implications on the usage of computer memory. Therefore, reducing the number of nodes and edges will bring direct benefits to the memory usage and reduction of the search time. In this study, four techniques for the reduction of search space size are compared and investigated. In this paper, frame nodes used in the hierarchical adaptive flood filled (HAFF) technique is presented.

However, it has been often noted, that although DLs are well-suited for representing a single, global viewpoint on an application domain, they offer no formal grounding for dealing with knowledge pertaining to multiple heterogeneous viewpoints \u2014 a scenario ever more often approached in practical applications, e.g. concerned with reasoning over distributed knowledge sources on the Semantic Web. In this paper, we study a natural extension of DLs, in the style of two-dimensional modal logics, which supports declarative modeling of viewpoints as contexts, in the sense of McCarthy, and their semantic interoperability. The formalism is based on two-dimensional semantics, where one dimension represents a usual object domain and the other a (possibly infinite) domain of viewpoints, addressed by additional modal operators and a metalanguage, on the syntactic level. We systematically introduce a number of expressive fragments of the proposed logic, study their computational complexity and connections to related formalisms.", "authors": [{"name": "Szymon  Klarman", "ids": ["3178562"]}, {"name": "V\u00edctor  Guti\u00e9rrez-Basulto", "ids": ["1400731651"]}], "inCitations": ["a22235d88be21c0a42a72dd58287b972dff5c0c5", "b32699499153b999a28f7f7ddc445af6f98ecf12", "bc0ee7d83bbb5cb0e27007d8ddf259ae82d1669a", "af3dbd85b6fe7e3222ffaa84153ac8b4b0985f41", "4913284940365d8eb06325af80b4d397b58b0e88", "c6d07604714c30bb28d52654f3471f556667249f", "4fb64ec5cf1a29f5d21f875a31aecc2c1cc97234", "89901080c4aa5ec0f401a73969c220c69a4ca06d", "3baeea389e83274a0a75223a99902d28a702b01d", "7b63c18eb7a4164ca9518376052fa2198209ffab", "f3affb194e1e988839081945311db1c989f6419c", "b789a9e90531227b579838540b1dc760a749f9dc", "5b111775e37426c3b5ed22cbb3e132caf26541d7", "b51ad8906aa9aa29bd2221847847da0b8bf05bd9", "b2c0f4f146e9649c44fd68aee84e51da11ed6530", "2241ea401b53821e790e564c57328ea6f2ea646b", "67a136552667b55d9675680d8dae2307f4311c0c", "446827f35f8c0cd07863c59beb7ad5aa50eef313", "95c483e97d041f258b7719b7a1c9096de7cd6d78", "0da4d606d33e843ab2e05f71c2596267cb926cd1", "ddaf5cd5cc3b1189a7f803c81e6fb3122f2be2b9", "2ac34385f338cf27459333a740fd8dd616e867f0", "29c55d0434b134cf6428c96121df93801a4298ed", "4c614c323a0a897ffd87325d927cd5020bc00460", "f1244531bdc3b6e4ba67a557b2deedcacc309299"], "outCitations": ["b3893b1a699620bea3cf61ff2648ca4d10fddcc7", "1c854084404536d95302b857de6c2856cf07b272", "0033b9d5b00c130aaf373b4038b1f33f36695d28", "63dc637595eec644f0462f87996fe90edc85c763", "713c531396dc37f70543b1664de7e73e0633609c", "fe57a038c49fa9c87aeafd71056802dbe6fda30d", "964c571d71fcb509db248e93b7de36eb896216b3", "eb7cfabee095cd9392ba2ff0f4d4ccfad0108427", "3d63e465a826ea1cc6bf6e82d1e99f29323f0c19", "5ab7819ef2d47818d92ed582185e542b22058bd6", "eb1908113afe1819d5b0213e6a587d306eaf488c", "b8f08a5efdd33581d4919504eca75d7410afbc10", "e98f20dd5ef7c03ceb3f089022d149634d1f4f63", "8483ef23ceb6f67ba3e841d68c5ae51718bdca5b", "af6c789dcc6b73bba5e9c0464af44616d1025c41", "5ca1ae1da54b2c3167ac0b8554dbf75ae29f5e02", "8473b3b4264e9998599dd52f278725d89a272107", "f25619ea1ee873c579c4ed30ff4d2a3a2e59e06c", "d40f82c46ec4d789bd1ad652aca63c8017d0781d", "ce1070e247a7ad66cb8b8758f14984df6e97ed78", "0c33631f99076a2947f815f1b1701c23d383a01f", "63559889e182d75764a7490dc5278792e60a104f"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ea6d1e70902fd4efa2d09e1de9bdd942ca9ea99d", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/download/3688/3856", "http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/tdki/research/papers/2011/KlaGutAAAI11.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/view/3688"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "215-220", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2396498452", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

The undecid-ability of reasoning on ASP with functions, implied that functions were subject to severe restrictions or disallowed at all, drastically limiting ASP applicability. We overcame most of the technical difficulties preventing this introduction, and we singled out a highly expressive class of programs with functions (FG-programs), allowing the (possibly recursive) use of function terms in the full ASP language with disjunction and negation. Reasoning on FG-programs is decidable, and they can express any computable function (causing membership in this class to be semi-decidable). We singled out also FD-programs, a subset of FG-programs which are effectively recognizable, while keeping the computability of reasoning. We implemented all results into the DLV system, thus obtaining an ASP system allowing to encode any computable function in a rich and fully declarative KRR language, ensuring termination on every FG program. Finally, we singled out the class of DFRP programs, where decidability of reasoning is guaranteed and Prolog-like functions are allowed.", "authors": [{"name": "Francesco  Calimeri", "ids": ["1748306"]}, {"name": "Susanna  Cozza", "ids": ["2134362"]}, {"name": "Giovambattista  Ianni", "ids": ["1693628"]}, {"name": "Nicola  Leone", "ids": ["144491891"]}], "inCitations": ["0d1ab792a32a93aad4a7579d51ada77f48ea86e1", "4d6b62ae55644bd8c76c84d937ed3e9b7778dd67", "94db950bb61436217ca7cff78db60ace314552b9", "e987a1b251e7d7e28b577369dda3890410697590", "6830e62c2aa2820fab001710aeaae6e3a5dea713", "22556a5753446459b0c532deac79fd2dd72a0b79", "8cee22c9d393523f89a807bdd7aaf82c929d8202", "18bdd7879c5131bb8576d19530fc98ec882d0218", "e809e60fc0f03f1a13d8f9e5612b7ddd8222baa3", "a09e14ee3c788bd46884662de5a0bae8359ee4a3", "87f8328daeb5f9a46a7e98d8065b8d180fe34615", "5e1a2ff30f5c2302eb8875985b1792b109382c48", "9377d3c17d7b76294928b5249f8fa065ed19ea06", "1c77121390de3978a9d8c36fa49a4ca5beef8d33", "1de1b1f57b958a0a145b53240b694154282abd5a", "f33a75f36308e01d980facabbb60743956cb81ce", "631a3368ba95d0a9b5ef58a01b6a40c075dbd19a"], "outCitations": ["386c60bc1cff7267e6a0ee03bb1a62cefa2a1cda", "c6571f19ef3683a942005aaa18726583957ed556", "555aba0ee0990f6a899106afca1545e906070c4b", "2e5df2005981ab546b5d414a844ebbe5a3f0cd2d", "c86608b8cd12dcc3d221fe3749f1d570c937fd1f", "3d8ce786f9e115ed7f4a6c12de41f728ae12354b", "dc74fec11f4666714d26554136fe272a715a85b5", "c4e7410be72006f91462fb291668069efe8dcc33", "038a293f914c094c3c5152508f978d619749d3ac", "96eefd7a5c30c1cb5225021165e0e3e1853cdab8", "84f04e5b0ca3c90be1e8494ab86eeeeb0fb22a6b", "0fa631d605a1192a2fda11c01a4d09f8545a1bc7", "c5b67ef8369edd56f868d4977eab313ab332cffd", "ff3421a824b022696881ee19a9b4067e2a269c95", "a859ce1d2507b68bf0a4f39c71b1cd1d06879ba6", "00518df675357addaeea0a042998782609f05cbb", "fd883cadf4475ce1c8e92f69f7dc19b30a52c448", "1c5179edddb4d7d563f6bceb45d5c248cf5a4fb8", "1888bbaf6203ddfacffa4ff70f5e01a102c29895"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d8085a87b6cac109f8ce30ee713dbed4a5e5ecf9", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1563/2276", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1563/2276", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1563"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "1666-1670", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "46596682", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

In this paper, a novel face recognition technique based on wavelet transform and Hierarchical Multi-scale Local Binary Pattern (HMLBP) is presented and shown to increase the accuracy of recognition of avatar faces. The proposed technique consists of three stages: preprocessing, feature extraction and recognition. In the preprocessing and feature extraction stages, the wavelet decomposition is used to enhance the common features of the same class of images and the HMLBP is used to extract representative features from each avatar face image without a need for any training. In the recognition stage, the Chi-Square distance is used to achieve a robust decision and to indicate the correct class to which the input image belongs. Experiments conducted on two manually cropped avatar image datasets (Second Life and Entropia Universe) show that the proposed technique performs better than traditional (single scale) LBP, Wavelet Local Binary Pattern (WLBP) and HMLBP in terms of accuracy (78.57% and 67.50% recognition rates for Second Life and Entropia Universe datasets respectively).", "authors": [{"name": "Abdallah A.

{"id": "32ada80666ffe457d60af2567014822ff92dcbe0", "title": "An Analysis of the Robustness and Fragility of the Coagulation System", "text": "The coagulation system (CS) is a complex, inter-connected biological system with major physiological and pathological roles. Adaptive mechanisms such as ubiquitous feedback and feedforward loops create non-linear relationships among its individual components and render the study of this biology at a molecular and cellular level nearly impossible. Computational modeling aims to overcome limitations of current analytical methods through in silico simulation of these complex interplays. We present herein an Agent Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) approach for simulating these complex interactions. Our ABMS approach utilizes a subset of 48 rules to define the interactions among 24 enzymes and factors of the CS. These rules simulate the interaction of each \u201cagent\u201d, such as substrates, enzymes, and cofactors, on a two-dimensional grid of ~3,000 cells and ~500,000 agents. Our ABMS method demonstrates the robustness of the physiologic CS system over large ranges of tissue factor (TF) concentrations. The system also demonstrates fragility as complete coagulation occurs at sufficiently high concentrations of TF. Removal of individual coagulation inhibitors from the physiologic system results in system fragility at relatively lower TF concentrations. The complete removal of coagulation inhibitors leads to a system that is incapable of controlling coagulation at all TF concentrations. The synergistic effects of the inhibitory pathways create an intricate regulatory mechanism that allows sufficient clot formation while preventing system wide activation of the CS; a robust system emerges.

First, most of them are not efficient for processing a large number of color document images. Second, most of them assumed the gray level of the background is higher than the foreground. In real color document images, the gray level of the background is lower than the foreground. Furthermore, some color document images, the backgrounds are in the middle of the gray level. Third, most of them do not consider the spatial characteristics. Thus, this paper proposes an efficient and effective background determination method for color document images to solve aforementioned problems. The proposal method includes following steps: First, RGB color space is transformed to gray level. Second, the boundary between the background and the foreground is determined by scan line differentiation algorithm. Third, the background and the foreground distributions in the ambit are analyzed to determine the background ranges. Finally, the document image is converted into binary image by the background ranges. This novel method is very efficient because it only analysis the border pixels in the color document image.

Our experiments in a complex real-time strategy game demonstrate the effective discovery of roles from supervised trajectories, the use of discovered roles for successful transfer to similar tasks, and the discovery of roles through reinforcement learning.", "authors": [{"name": "Aaron  Wilson", "ids": ["144056302"]}, {"name": "Alan  Fern", "ids": ["145841336"]}, {"name": "Prasad  Tadepalli", "ids": ["1729906"]}], "inCitations": ["7abeac6e7218e9ff87517d9301d888271c367afb", "e5ce1e2222ae553c1762aa61e93bd3ee74d18acd", "2f97a4bac542ee46d8e8af5e7e3fc481bd3fc4bb", "79718537ebbfc11a58f7e7f122903d8a72e4ddf9", "5764095b0186a3fc3832c1052aa14996a5927edc", "f9f254d35d89463b32c69a77bf6835c9edcefc89"], "outCitations": ["b90b5b0cf05bc63f768f55322381f5cfbee6ce1c", "5ce166a981446f5a2b93fceb507f78f2f435ca73", "33de518ff6ab4261d94544dc029460c6cf00117c", "63afef5c22277fb4bf1bc1d185f7d71c9a34e557", "ee2c379e8124d8dd58dd1f0272fc45d32c7d1d36", "596dac923657992a817d3d68ae83f2fba9cf1ab8", "ba4bcd8c4ebb1427d335c23d50249d370778ae49", "91e62d27c08db29cf011a0326a61509e574cf772", "48cce5ee49facf75eeb12832c387452424b645dd", "ab19a482195f4299f96b98e4eb15cb3ad4753f3b", "40e4d0eaff2ce7538ecff773bda326388a87b515", "a754de170e099eafb72d74e70e7a300846c31902", "30a8d1e9c37969034e4823332a05de8536e4fded", "480d517574a079d3e0159b978cb19b3f014e59a3"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/77b9b2835a5b2466cbd73b8cc2514b9a470dd1d1", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://engr.case.edu/ray_soumya/mlrg/2010%20Bayesian%20Policy%20Search%20for%20Multi-Agent%20Role%20Discovery.pdf", "http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tadepall/papers/aaai2010-role-based.pdf", "http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~afern/papers/aaai10-wilson.pdf", "http://www.cs.orst.edu/~afern/papers/aaai10-wilson.pdf", "http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tadepall/research/papers/aaai2010-role-based.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1799/2052", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1799"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "624-629", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1512681781", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Nonconvex penalties such as the minimax concave plus (MCP) and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), have been demonstrated to have the properties of sparsity practically and theoretically. In this paper we propose a new nonconvex penalty that we call exponential-type penalty. The exponential-type penalty is characterized by a positive parameter, which establishes a connection with the l0 and l1 penalties. We apply this new penalty to sparse supervised learning problems. To solve to resulting optimization problem, we resort to a reweighted l1 minimization method. Moreover, we devise an efficient method for the adaptive update of the tuning parameter. Our experimental results are encouraging.

However, one can not compute the generalization error for a given problem exactly. Therefore, many research efforts have been put to estimate the generalization error for a given classification problem. The Localized Generalization Error Model (L-GEM) is one of the recently proposed analytical generalization error upper bound models. In the L-GEM, an upper bound of generalization error of unseen samples within a Q-neighborhood of training samples is provided. The L-GEM has been widely adopted in many application areas, e.g. image classification, corporate credit risk prediction and construction productivity enhancement in civil engineering. However, the selection of Q value is vital to the success of L-GEM to application problems.

GDL inherits from Datalog the use of Horn clauses as rules and recursion, but it too requires stratification and does not allow to use quantifiers. We present an alternative formalism for game description which is based on first-order logic (FO). States of the game are represented by relational structures, legal moves by structure rewriting rules guarded by FO formulas, and the goals of the players by formulas which extend FO with counting. The advantage of our formalism comes from more explicit state representation and from the use of quantifiers in formulas. We show how to exploit existential quantification in players' goals to generate heuristics for evaluating positions in the game. The derived heuristics are good enough for a basic alpha-beta agent to win against state of the art GGP.", "authors": [{"name": "Lukasz  Kaiser", "ids": ["40527594"]}, {"name": "Lukasz  Stafiniak", "ids": ["3140227"]}], "inCitations": ["3e86b0795d88b99304d45c0200ab08629421ef64", "bc7362a2a26a9501189c74fabaea34ba3b4bd0b6", "d9999a5d4780130fcb6ec341054601d491a96c66", "31ac620fe891679107b98676342e4844714248d8", "5cfa5e54d34ab13e596240003a90dded6802b1c4", "2a84e524a859450d0816e22ea6b981d448a7b5cc"], "outCitations": ["7cce213df14aa475736fd32045e3b43920f9ac9b", "ccf5208521cb8c35f50ee8873df89294b8ed7292", "27b4c23097aac723711be6b523704d75a32e8cf0", "0f71e062357cf348e4075e0bc74aece7d73fc49d", "8cbcab8eacee75d4811ef38db83b124c3ecea084", "14686da14b24a10a0612a5de83c3af36c6d06a63", "db1561f582ade45effc7dbf4089166da9733cc87", "d5600f2128ec86f113b7a5c36ee94383dec21edc", "78571af6c05ea9c4bca4e3ec9edd7bc2a36879cb", "c89c71dbe5617bea44383585b58cd0cbc37bf79a"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c8b262617164704c6c49a5dfc7c2a15c994de861", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/view/3727", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI11/paper/download/3727/3961", "http://www.liafa.jussieu.fr/~kaiser/pub/first_order_counting_ggp.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "791-796", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2402743501", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

The results show that the improved AHP is a new, scientific and simple method for the sequence of important influence factors in urban-rural conjunctive passenger transportation system.", "authors": [{"name": "Bao-Zhen  Guo", "ids": ["2472554"]}, {"name": "Xin-Rui  Zhang", "ids": ["47958330"]}], "inCitations": [], "outCitations": ["6bf67ed8974ee214b7b35cb11dc8440ddc77bcb0", "6af5e9c1f0918b914e8bb9ee5bedd7838ec002ab", "f2d3081144eeac329e309a28d0125581a44d722d", "928a9fdeba3713ce33a3a6d617e2015628cb1fb7", "d0d68f88d705279c48686f510df0cfbefe55f1f2", "4be165fa325edb7d0c38f39af25f77f599368380"], "year": 2009, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/919640d2d339bdb252e1c535be8d16c114700dbf", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": [], "venue": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "5", "journalPages": "2499-2503", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212103", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212103", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2130960936", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

In order to cope with the curse of dimensionality, our method proceeds in a fashion similar to block coordinate descent in finite-dimensional optimization: at each iteration, the motion is optimized over a lower dimensional subspace while leaving the path fixed along the other dimensions. Naive implementations of such an idea can produce vastly suboptimal results. In this work, we show how a profitable set of directions in which to perform this dimensional descent procedure can be learned efficiently. We provide sufficient conditions for global optimality of dimensional descent in this learned basis, based upon the low-dimensional structure of the planning cost function. We also show how this dimensional descent procedure can easily be used for problems that do not exhibit such structure with monotonic convergence. We illustrate the application of our method to high dimensional shape planning and arm trajectory planning problems.", "authors": [{"name": "Paul  Vernaza", "ids": ["2998590"]}, {"name": "Daniel D.

The upshot is that narrative agency is contextually situated, distributed between the player and system, and mediated through user interpretation of system behavior and system affordances for user actions. In our new and developing model of agency play, multiple dimensions of agency can be tuned during story execution as a narratively situated mechanism to convey meaning. More importantly, we propose that this model of variable dimensions of agency can be used as an expressive theoretical tool for interactive narrative design. Finally, we present our current interactive narrative work under development as a case study for how the agency play model can be deployed expressively.", "authors": [{"name": "D.

Sixtyeight (N=68) undergraduate students learned about the human circulatory system under one of three conditions: prompt and feedback (PF), prompt-only (PO), and control (C) condition. The PF condition received timely prompts from animated pedagogical agents to engage in planning processes, monitoring processes, and learning strategies and also received immediate directive feedback from the agents concerning the deployment of the processes. The PO condition received the same timely prompts, but did not receive any feedback following the deployment of the processes. Finally, the control condition learned without any assistance from the agents during the learning session. All participants had two hours to learn using a 41-page hypermedia environment which included texts describing and static diagrams depicting various topics concerning the human circulatory system. Results indicate that the PF condition had significantly higher learning efficiency scores, when compared to the control condition. There were no significant differences between the PF and PO conditions. These results are discussed in the context of development of a fully-adaptive hypermedia learning system intended to scaffold self-regulated learning. Objectives and Theoretical Framework When learning about complex science topics such as the human circulatory system, research indicates that individuals can gain deep conceptual understanding through effective use of self-regulated learning (SRL). The successful use of cognitive and metacognitive SR processes involves setting meaningful goals for one\u2019s learning, planning a course of action for attaining these goals, deploying a diverse set of effective learning strategies in pursuit of the goals, continuously monitoring one\u2019s own understanding of the material and the appropriateness of the current information, and making adaptations to one\u2019s goals, strategies, and navigational patterns, based on the results of such monitoring processes and their resulting judgments (Azevedo, 2005; Azevedo & Witherspoon, 2009; Opfermann, Azevedo, & Leutner, in press; Pintrich, 2000; Winne, 2001; Winne & Hadwin, 2008; Zimmerman, 2001; Zimmerman & Schunk, in press). Although learners should attempt to follow these guidelines when attempting difficult topics, exploration of typical learning has demonstrated that few learners, in fact, engage in effective self-regulated learning. We assume that, while motivation and affect play a role in determining learners\u2019 willingness to self-regulate, a lack of selfregulatory skills is the main obstacle to adequate regulation and therefore deficient learning gains and conceptual understanding (Azevedo & Jacobson, 2008; Shapiro, 2008; Schwartz et al., 2009; White, Frederiksen, & Collins, 2009). Therefore, our current research is directed toward scaffolding learners\u2019 use of self-regulation using artificial pedagogical agents (PAs) during learning with MetaTutor, a multi-agent adaptive hypermedia learning environments that models, scaffolds, and fosters learners\u2019 use of cognitive and metacognitive SRL processes during learning about human biology. Learners attempting to self-regulate often face limitations in their own metacognitive skills, which, when compounded with lack of domain knowledge, can result in cognitive overload in open-ended learning environments like hypermedia (Azevedo, Johnson, Chauncey, & Graesser, in press; Leelawong & Biswas, 2008; McQuiggan, Robinson, & Lester, 2010). One method of relieving the cognitive burden placed on learners in this situation is to provide assistance in the form of adaptive scaffolding. Previous experiments conducted by Azevedo and colleagues (e.g., Azevedo, Cromley, Winters, Moos, & Greene, 2005; Azevedo, Moos, Greene, Winters, & Cromley, 2008) established that adaptive scaffolding 11 Cognitive and Metacognitive Educational Systems: Papers from the AAAI Fall Symposium (FS-10-01)", "authors": [{"name": "Roger  Azevedo", "ids": ["145394858"]}, {"name": "Amy  Johnson", "ids": ["145594129"]}, {"name": "Candice  Burkett", "ids": ["2523432"]}, {"name": "Amber Chauncey Strain", "ids": ["2720841"]}, {"name": "Mihai C.

However, df-pn has a notorious problem of infinite loops when applied to domains with repetitions. Df-pn(r) cures it by ignoring proof and disproof numbers that may lead to infinite loops. This paper points out that df-pn(r) has a serious issue of underestimating proof and disproof numbers, while it also suffers from the overestimation problem occurring in directed acyclic graph. It then presents two practical solutions to these problems. While bypassing infinite loops, the threshold controlling algorithm (TCA) solves the underestimation problem by increasing the thresholds of df-pn. The source node detection algorithm (SNDA) detects the cause of overestimation and modifies the computation of proof and disproof numbers. Both TCA and SNDA are implemented on top of df-pn to solve tsume-shogi (checkmating problem in Japanese chess). Results show that df-pn with TCA and SNDA is far superior to df-pn(r).

We show #P-hardness of the counting variant of POSSIBLE-WINNER for plurality and veto and give a simple yet general and practically useful randomized algorithm for a variant of POSSIBLE-WINNER for all voting rules for which a winner can be computed in polynomial time.", "authors": [{"name": "Yoram  Bachrach", "ids": ["1698412"]}, {"name": "Nadja  Betzler", "ids": ["1847469"]}, {"name": "Piotr  Faliszewski", "ids": ["2469517"]}], "inCitations": ["e2a88818302ad3a35daee2ace366143526679e25", "506befddccf5c5c9105d3b040510e23642e9fe67", "621f3b73612a0d71abc64906594b2c2f43190e80", "1fa69608666e66452df56b1f71282def7ac16035", "52b2535e930c38daccb07c5c0167325cf7570f3a", "bd84dfc06281ffee2b4d7838bc12a47cbff0dc15", "c13bc6b71197173d14b16acbb4896a0d1ac86818", "6dbefe808408c3cbf1e7f0a380a57a380cde1082", "85603b82d0ee041f9f848fdcb57999032f279783", "1ebd09ac911626d30a1f6405541fc1f73575b9e6", "cc9d34f8479ab932a2e2f216f9e39166ad4b0396", "d960ed2e7df41101064adffa7b81bec7ede6cff5", "8f16a5686e8637c1e593c3f230d7b038ecf42a85", "b9b07e9d617fd92362e89a5cb44f80ed99dbdb82", "7d6deb02714c08f93a097ff64a0ea47264178c3f", "cb32671c086be7041fb2cd1012cf4e2733ac1459", "b2642c25f7ca7c7201e414a65164fd3ac2ba7e58", "ad97035d5d36c5a1b39ae43cacecc358f725c83b", "9f77cc6f9143c914cc122fd39a8706a6e0767d26", "dcea2a1f1a6314f93508cda1182fc9f1a387f8c5", "927f4916ab22a7d06d4dd9cef2916191ddf06c8b", "9f86c5870acbd1bc261d4211ad66e200bebaae7a", "b304ba8f031da6685bc2ac78452f64b3f1d7d9e0", "f712ffcf518392436efddec13f9f617b6e49e2d1", "3455724180e91417292f518fd4088ccb67c30ca5", "c73605a19c4f06732bb2824f12626144bddd8161", "536145435bf6841dd689e7c28e7d1954b0fe1ec5", "5df6fd682e83f5d9893a63344bf7667d1a89eee0", "0860a697c1562507d4ac13d5087e147fbdee43b1", "e6a06773f9e9e04a402c3fe342dbc90aea7cf8ef", "5d545e15763882f8ed34dffa9e59508c615cb09e", "91cc33c246c2bcc4bf74f806d06af548bcff8b93", "307cca5091fbf4ad1e2abcbb96011207e912f6cd", "1b0b3d6a02f57aa8b1416d6ef20b813c4bbe2b62", "1b5784e61413748feb066f8b340366d6b6af52f5", "e2c1893af6f2428c197d492d1e48611c337f8711", "3be7b7bd085738b881252370133e9d778f3963d0", "c74ab25d3ae4e7242524776aedb46d4191f606df", "76327c56fbb763f21309cd5f618931160226d90d", "3105b5863d4597058bf51aeda40db53394075784", "c847e9715a0fc04745792750452e420ba480be9a", "99621a7f74d7c9e8e93c3a909ad44a3dc515854d", "4219cfaa8383e9c53eec400040dcde9c065c5027", "068090179262a7e6ee4242b9df5be255bcd9b088", "86935624260f4c2cfa45d5a052a594ce36f4910d", "b874cf53f30f05c2ad889644c04747cbf22c1401", "58700af80443071a2676e77064b542b93c8266f4", "dfe83ba4dce5ada2bb1643b29f55a8fcaa2a8a89", "22892e4e4826d7154a4416a7d134a7920ed4582c", "55d5d8fab7403d5bb9d982dddfcc917eb282eb11", "62d858ab9964be4510c1722fda02f677b24780d0"], "outCitations": ["f0ee27482b0fe4e8883b95a67dc759be250e9c5a", "4eb678fe110052b138adb6bca94cefb366839e55", "bf1722ed8c19f79a0d2588fc5b4dc8dbf5501037", "7130e9ebdbccff73954fd737c6ff9056f95be63b", "980dd068cc4515af1378e13699d9552533af7a33", "03f7ea66d9b8c4c49ec563c1f36783d9c05e2c5a", "f506f95e69c2570564355361e872c7f97b5da80c", "42ae40a85a2b9e41197bacfdecd1576b02ab8827", "e7c4e7ada0998529f657909d9c61a6006cd8885f", "9c188b3291a7e83d667764be3377a99e15b4d988", "2972ad55099f656cbec1968c3e852796811b4cf1", "e2936d09b91f6d5b900c5481f257ce31bc395705", "823316de43154bf2d2c02edc5262f97197b76020", "3e029d7407ed7ff5e96edea3d1f6c79ee33a1c11", "e2b9bfd3b990fcb63a6f3d42fc4b438b940b1a28", "c66db9b93d75c0ff52e7f84605b8389345307006", "9fea7cccea86aeb5802ed8a7544ab9198e933896", "dc75d69f457f566615aa68e0bd8d26ae06807eda", "74bff1c695d515815afdec8d8f2bb3ef50c327b4", "cd0140364338e49d57775ae04d4f6320760b6815", "e88ef825436467b88a69df24d6854f7a662449cf"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3a43c8d59820cdbd1a746e448fd92bd8b9dc75b3", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://fpt.akt.tu-berlin.de/publications/counting.pdf", "http://www.akt.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/fg34/publications-akt/counting.pdf", "http://fpt.akt.tu-berlin.de/betzler/aaai10.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1692/2067", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/viewFile/1692/2067/", "http://theinf1.informatik.uni-jena.de/publications/counting.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1692"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "697-702", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1497863661", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

Recent development of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) has produced superb performance on scientific computing problems using massive parallel processing cores. However, due to the limited size of device memory, many GPU based algorithms have low capability in solving problems with large datasets. In this paper, a chunking method is proposed to calculate Euclidean distance matrix on large datasets. This is not only designed for scalability in multi-GPU environment but also to maximize the computational capability of each individual GPU device. We first implement a fast GPU algorithm that is suitable for calculating sub matrices of Euclidean distance matrix. Then we utilize a Map-Reduce like framework to split the final distance matrix calculation into many small independent jobs of calculating partial distance matrices, which can be efficiently solved by our GPU algorithm. The framework also dynamically allocates GPU resources to those independent jobs for maximum performance. The experimental results have shown a speed up of 15x on datasets which contain more than half million data points.", "authors": [{"name": "Qi  Li", "ids": ["37696683"]}, {"name": "Vojislav  Kecman", "ids": ["2886979"]}, {"name": "Raied  Salman", "ids": ["145724802"]}], "inCitations": ["89090c8b2361efff0b122e428778d0659ead0f77", "6052e389f7efae86ba785cbecddc0e4ad64ca3a4", "54cdb52d7afcb6091d42b124db5c4f0213969dd4", "416e96c271958e12a59906b502791c3012af360f", "57d87450078e0cf9caac3cde6f69e45b6b6a7760", "6c7f7f11f74a8138fbe9a0ec5dcd11ee3f609c96", "47ac10e4e9ddabaecec4bbc10bd77a4e60c7e941", "a7e8f393728dc000a2febd655f2d320772550cc6", "767c1e6164df3938baaa75dec4de1b1f74d16ea9", "afc22b3de9af6ef0e500af8f1892f3f92218e187", "1a90e28d59e68912bd91e9ac79224b249a72c152", "e91a9d1c7707f81b3d1d1af171875ce7c0538d83", "b4ae347de8a8075bea322f77ca68d90ee300dc8b", "0641cdadf426a3c73850ad3ff1f02e3a6f92f9be", "e3f8bc307eb93dd62c60ead206d24a5b87729de9", "ed6c3723faebbee0a17ccf6ceaf80a93dba52d5d", "327572e9828b98cbd6f823ac1c215ca7062bf177", "c703457d6af2a1837f82136fd0da90c6efa6dd4e", "74acb80f0b5aa4e0febb69d512bf49d69b1ddf23", "f2bb9f4b7df21ea550a81ad8079cdda314c0a5fc", "477574f474fe6834f5f11c762a60ca38b258aa88", "d04017d3400c10e10e16cdb4c5a6124d524f6122", "29e78f6c6e21cdc6a939783e21f8a87062193ee5", "e1d57b0c5d9c32920a93eb3b1d8dc703e7a0c246", "47447bbb6dc4a3018274be67a19aa12930088097", "859ecf7ba238f24e2ffc554b47970d7847d1da70", "7e320cfe1241eca9a1eb0cd0a44c45b3c8a8d4d5", "28b82f06a31a77c1ddd38ba744f653c3080f00ff", "fce91a92b3c153f876595653cef347c2a2186ca9", "1313aa97002890ee0bbaeb433cbd17a09559286b", "abc9c31b6b1dce1e5a9656b6e28aefbbaa92a19c", "0e3bf64525160772e9104427fef98934159710d5", "d72ce39c519cdaa971a6649b77f12f2c7d70be10", "1918c45a211fdb5af930292dd855a3de9c47a9df", "be9fc4b872b5370a4a9a87e91a1355636d4fbf80", "2b5b21a106bc1efefaca14d81bc43604f99f3bf2", "48c1318c4af56b6ffa13a2cdc132de62acd35fce", "1393a61e63f438676a377d2e9b9e907732eba041", "f2fbc67e506a144fab7aafa39fa67b9766760866", "3db3684054bf31181a89b67fc22d9f4e6a0eb812", "886e2a62fefbcff6393296c2b7d5960f61816894", "e0240b008d1a6e00ba568a415af9fafeff142888", "0d08060412306ef89ee877c8d99ffbaf03104366", "ef75284e14c8af479396db98a1356914c849ce95", "3945a0695ce17025ce5f79e1ebb9f9b32dc58dd1", "28664728406e732ce04ddee931547af8ab5b1c8a", "9c8bed031be5d78a726338116e9186d07a21d580", "2f54f63a3e21b5e7c8e247bdf99d614a93a95a7c", "2efcf4467c3a91e03fe08d88afc70ab03e98d959", "c857d3fe4145fc046fe71706f6901ff33f1fc02e", "70d0b4a3cc4fc9b36e174c39ff3347027faf46b1", "4c7121d894c58b44997d08b9086a48515b54eb21", "fb00efc7937064aa66f6d6c0ee30b5a842b200f8", "bd2c3063e880cc34da455286ead301650ed1e295", "ead405a690a2f7db22ce6b44e13def02092478b6", "6c4be3a24a8fb7b611df50d786b15d6a21abd79d", "addedb0cbf3c028601626121c667b5afca11ce98", "47bb1ad9da38b383afae3131281635c19a918e0b", "3547ff4a383f57316b47b03c0d18d4d832b2fd3d", "8d4b0530dcfc5e847fe1a03ffb397ce79af296dc", "ae99bec26bb055bcc68abc001564d81893758b4c", "e1b514611e5dbaa40a747416b6c42674f2752db6", "dd13de711994ca546a4bdacb5adb11632425e9ca"], "outCitations": ["2635f61333900a6b4cd9b5db5d4c3bc31363b2ff", "162d958ff885f1462aeda91cd72582323fd6a1f4", "488d2a77874ff8b98f6464df1d93d68c211f1f73", "19d2b786fec5ded4d6cdca0e21f3c3f5264ecadf", "f045ec92c44c872565a6bedfdac61ee031ab5dfc", "4af838ccab830ba5787412f95f902c1a383d0b81", "f42b865e20e61a954239f421b42007236e671f19", "7eee285127586136e77adaf6c71a6e6ef1def108", "b1fc4afb925b10fe277298b217cc3474ecee4413", "ce56688ea6cf1761425d407ed4cf1c5d12e01212"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3c7bf8a1b91548513871b380d26fc305db393f70", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vojislav_Kecman/publication/221226312_A_Chunking_Method_for_Euclidean_Distance_Matrix_Calculation_on_Large_Dataset_Using_Multi-GPU/links/00b7d5297125c9f25e000000.pdf", "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vojislav_Kecman/publication/221226312_A_Chunking_Method_for_Euclidean_Distance_Matrix_Calculation_on_Large_Dataset_Using_Multi-GPU/links/00b7d5297125c9f25e000000.pdf", "http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2010.38"], "venue": "2010 Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalName": "2010 Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "208-213", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2010.38", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2010.38", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2116511687", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Its theoretical research contains convergence proof and runtime analysis. The convergence of ACO has been proved since several years ago, but there are less results of runtime analysis of ACO algorithm except for some special and simple cases. The present paper proposes a theoretical framework of a class of ACO algorithms. The ACO algorithm is modeled as an absorbing Markov chain. Afterward its convergence can be analyzed based on the model, and the runtime of ACO algorithm is evaluated with the convergence time which reflects how many iteration times ACO algorithms spend in converging to the optimal solution. Moreover, the runtime analysis result is advanced as an estimation method, which is used to study a binary ACO algorithm as a case study.", "authors": [{"name": "Zhongming  Yang", "ids": ["1847064"]}, {"name": "Han  Huang", "ids": ["2236053"]}, {"name": "Zhaoquan  Cai", "ids": ["40286498"]}, {"name": "Yong  Qin", "ids": ["144104145"]}], "inCitations": ["3cc9095deb3cdfa87ad7a5e6b3aa5c679596b576"], "outCitations": ["ade0167e69873ab5e2e771b86cc493c38a3d6624", "cb4368eab957ded0ce8c587c4fda165a26bc5a22", "1229de2f044a097a0dcbfe3daec0f4fc9bd34882", "242e7af00d6c56c4299a73a5ed4c6d97725243f7", "9b9d8c282a4ebfc2a6a92d7b4c2bbac804431fb1", "bfc6800560a4135b50a511c0dc790e6006f10f0e", "94ecf087db56a9fed5c3622baa5b2a9a1767435e", "04d150d37de8495381b5928d742df9628961f7ea", "5d4f9b82841062c8c1323dcbc72e7c572ba00bcc", "38d95f9002cf442543268a8c6ef952e43160de1d", "6d623a18d2977c2535bbaadef6f5c28b8b06f8e2", "706b634be4fb2c117d44bc2d8b275ab1987856c9", "cbd20726fb917d6fa79bff8866da776b49753dac", "c67818b2ce1410ba61f29e1f77412fe23c69f346", "3fba1f1a7ff44c933c5e7a5a6b409670aa2eebc8", "95b59b38262ac2312012dbc3a487012df97365c6", "c6cf303963eddd5af226168cd0dd30f2baead7a6", "d6423b13bfc88a85efd01ff1334bd5d9402b4ac5", "5252e82f5f3b1d6633e2e4560653385af7323768", "ffbe49ae5b99b99c9b62f0d7187dfa0b2dbfd185", "fccf8166cf204afbab292424c06cbfe76e4aa5e8", "24a9c478ba27a78eb1af84eaddb9b8e3573aca41"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/942c69b349007fdf5e10d1e3f852ca3d240da20b", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580959"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "4", "journalPages": "1817-1822", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580959", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580959", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2014644864", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

{"id": "699fff2e81c4d7cc5234e6f375a2477c2948da1c", "title": "As-index based Collaborative Filtering recommendation algorithm", "text": "Most recommendation systems employ Collaborative Filtering (CF) for formulating suggestions of items relevant to users' interests, which commonly uses k-nearest neighbors searching algorithm (kNN) and recommends an item to a user based on the users' rating table. With the users' number increasing, it meets the real-time problem and the scalable problem. In this paper, we propose the original AS-INDEX based CF (ASCF). ASCF firstly proposes the index structure (AS-INDEX) based on angular similarity, which refers to the axis and a reference-line to organize the rating table into some shell-hyper-cones, and linearly stores them.

Task scheduling in multiprocessor system is a NP-complete problem. In literature, several heuristic methods have been developed that obtain suboptimal solutions in less than the polynomial time. Recently, Genetic algorithms have received much awareness as they are robust and guarantee for a good solution. In this paper, we have developed a genetic algorithm based on the principles of evolution found in nature for finding an optimal solution. Genetic algorithm is based on three operators: Natural Selection, Crossover and Mutation. To compare the performance of our algorithm, we have also implemented another scheduling algorithm HEFT which is a heuristic algorithm. Simulation results comprises of three parts: Quality of solutions, robustness of genetic algorithm, and effect of mutation probability on performance of genetic algorithm.", "authors": [{"name": "Sachi  Gupta", "ids": ["8897917"]}, {"name": "Vikas  Kumar", "ids": ["145889433"]}, {"name": "Gaurav  Agarwal", "ids": ["47979553"]}], "inCitations": ["25bfd9e4d0ac88be506bdae5f825df9a8fd47396", "2543a4bf1026bc18fe097656a292de4e0dcd9d6a", "9630b01e99655c109a9aa53efd7395422424a944", "2c0587fc7b9517324a3bdbdc7b74238bc7d3021c", "aaeeafed0b774392d5fbec3d25ec32d830a411bb", "f61b028c1c1ab690a86e69f21883bde53e4738e1", "6c7e85bae559fd136dda1d1339458bb99cd24625", "66d5a642fac4f9b68573a65ed56b2751202e4241", "46679f7de7c3aca4a9c2b256341e0cc9b031b205", "83bf377f2531d0b9bdda9524dfee5b74947bb4e1", "20b1da0c03bd8b8961d6c22612065370a16f5163", "0d7ae94357e93c75e48a645219e49389dedb86f0", "3b0da6d332b907c43f9a35c7f93873e65dbc86e3", "203a56ae476cbbf0d58df2e3dc99731804cbb674", "9573319acb3a4c49da6d0775743528763b29ce6d", "144a884c682c6f27ac61c3d96d4ec8fdfe3391d0", "fb60c42d317d9fca07ef37e71d7d80f2d0711493", "2520f8cfcb7dc81c78e41f8f94dc378fb7dc4828", "6a898476915883288dd6394f51a3b60077a9bc49", "802dd4b0aedc3e677bea225df81eec1ce9f9f38a", "4aaec9d328bf2291b0da81d3649041f3dea83ee3", "e8118bd3cac14dd4248e943ce1457bda60f35e32", "2c5d31ea513a03254aa2b43f567e0dd8779ec0b8", "323b569451b7fb07f5af5da9dba809de9b24a213", "9293fcacde2a4babbe416079cecac38033b99453", "babd2ad7d84c04b60c29a8e108809a76959f3f0e", "12e5079fa6985f969083e21259a681f44be0b030", "efc37542be56df272b876a4216b8cdea39b53592", "e3ab3e628162e3448d6d01ef8bb72e91d84df17f", "6368476b866f1eba1fa5a44e888b03756760b8de", "6f040be5f653f1cf924c7f871b0cfe309bcec39c", "fccd381c5cd73679117978cca1f6a43bf380c965", "5663e11f6aa14037df1fc2b1642c053f4628a927", "14736ad2b006ad5f3a8abc21f53bcb7eb65230fb", "9236c8b171136bd8c96993700a52f5ed821eb725", "8430ad65d26a915151152be88f846a0567b4187d", "53089d5f9259fe7df8f04b7dc1e87bb93d89cbf1", "d28416ccff5fac89b38aac0e4bab0607d140d23a", "4d201394df7a9a0ca8e12112ffdee297697324a8", "d82d1134ba3790d67d36e408d4b2d6d6df8827e1", "ca467ee56f76221bb67a6be641f74332b0ed7770", "9adb83a487725ae071c8b961a7dc268529986112", "5de5a40d119ed64db6a8fbf9c5f22774d07887bf", "15682fbb9918f7d3de030ff7f99601573786e157", "30ffe34ca7bb1b7b40164611a119549a301a1ce7", "4d083349f6d49632f879d536f7100f53d56fed89", "03c2f994a46d07980c5bf8e300fa1b263f71354a", "6142a4271a613fa0736e147733841a59fa557db0", "aff99e65f203533af9eb136b6b40b2f30ea0ff4e", "9bbf50c236bce79ef3bda05cdc3d934187b69ef6", "30bf1e1128e79f10163184ea6f86ae6f4d291f5f", "02c1241c3192ed6093dcd103189a8640f5a45537", "41c855d9298ae2c1854078a5b2b8d1cbbe623aaa"], "outCitations": ["2730606a9d29bb52bcc42124393460503f736d74", "293d2084e5c9872e2864d5c39ec53138d96f3ef5", "34b241f9287591a95581bf35b4fc0072a5e2485a", "6f0859eb31cb85ca3bd4f92aa1f0297077af63b0", "55ad5dcfb14f4cf68e8eb474d4045d8f5a5d28bd", "3c69abae8182063d37c8803966ac1addffc296d0", "ada56e1f7575d7f542215c48625c161ab060bed0", "73be8ad32db73d4f4f50c5dd96d71bdfb02ea9bb", "56c4193bc36be6591de43a98b49dea2526d86f8d", "3d6eeb67ec4831238ee060b86f7efc9c411b630d", "e16e539e8b8c0718c8bd5c46f15eadd92345e25f", "1bfa726c382fb71e79e053422744520cdf601076", "7a2daf5e178937ae1157f6195ff76a7eb667b8f8", "7fc5859635b8779519698c33168256fd99ac3741", "aa61028fb9c0404d11aecf1112313e6aaaa83d01", "039f918d5cbe50f161ef86e32c60764721677340", "bef4e2419015b6fa2d8f6d076c8a148fbe2a4848", "47151fa3a8bff3ea1ac4ef8aa32ca4b6e9118217", "4b4279db68b16e20fbc56f9d41980a950191d30a", "4f147cf19662d00953010146d30a87b95000ac0b", "0ffdbf24ded3ad03cf70a9bb496f6eea91bc88e8", "2e62d1345b340d5fda3b092c460264b9543bc4b5", "d20784178e0c8f25849313b3f8f2c418707c1a4a", "7b55bdecededce32f0bbcefe6b4d06b87e8bac9b", "25ad1c0a40278dd2fcb0d31d4f16d4a58a24528f", "bdede1e17c947540b50e6e2db9e8467ddc6e7336", "8ed1d9f5a017c61abfec4089aba828b398aa3e7e", "1f400c9732c13eae95be34a181c2b8042a774a39", "09a68ab22266f56ce91622ad2548eef80ff0ea92", "e9c353b8fb4a45863e74ae5e561914d2a7810a03"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f494d91aa1abdde746fa101fd2fe54cbeb5be4bd", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.irjes.com/Papers/vol2-issue11/C02111018.pdf"], "venue": "2010 Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing", "journalName": "2010 Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "267-271", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.50", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.50", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1978559775", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

Evidence for a table\u2019s meaning can be found in its column headers, cell values, implicit relations between columns, caption and surrounding text but also requires general and domain-specific background knowledge. We describe techniques grounded in graphical models and probabilistic reasoning to infer meaning (semantics) associated with a table using background knowledge from the Linked Open Data cloud. We represent a table\u2019s meaning by mapping columns to classes in an appropriate ontology, linking cell values to literal constants, implied measurements, or entities in the linked data cloud (existing or new) and discovering or and identifying relations between columns.", "authors": [{"name": "Varish  Mulwad", "ids": ["1805399"]}, {"name": "Tim  Finin", "ids": ["144121207"]}, {"name": "Anupam  Joshi", "ids": ["145029954"]}], "inCitations": ["6472971a427ecdaf86cb887ed2f28fb0308c5235", "8ffcad9346c4978a211566fde6807d6fb4bfa5ed", "8e9d76a2155e672fb7efe023640c3d4a44310601", "62617d92e798b14bf0677d24a9910eb90aa1a46a", "8115f0aff21c239cece25ef5ccd956879f22c04d", "e50b4fe851d5f06f6d2d5838d763250fe9fb8df8", "b763f20d02dd31685dad362af856c8ea629172ac", "736eca50aa4a4960c442e70b3a13b1fae24b08ee", "cb0eea4074c114966e4ca16f9d9d36b537fb367a", "1b586a093b5b0d42f785182969d5d4ef57de3c44", "ef730733cfbf55c0abb91bf7871ba9db35ab4f46", "b2cdcd5386c1c272a3abf081b6bd911bcd577e29", "cec406c26c8d1380a16fd60a41fd6a27728b2705", "8ef339756526ac4f7d708a8402cc7b0510dfac01", "bfea13d48a414a47a7914a73597c95f2ba9313a8", "fb61d870e595fede569b6de64a39d80547f31342", "7ad0b861f0abc3878f933b710ad89f17c91d5a1d"], "outCitations": ["6b5077161a6f55a0d18cdfa3abbb612663d08d69", "1b5b374c10a553cc19bf59a51a09159b8d0e20d3", "53f5249ff2dc66a7a8a3ccabca24911e932a98b4", "de1cb5b2dc52bd1ac5d80c61d875a91b6f8b61b2", "07554d53dd3b37a5183b2b85e0aaa1a5a2d7e20a", "e195856010ea85e1ad925e91da5368c7cc282e2a", "c44cef69334cb62e6f6c7d0d245e1934f599815f", "1d3c9b806c3d4fe0eb43ebaae8864910a7ddd4a9", "fca75fb11bc8dcb01e687a0bcb00dc50e81bfac6", "d0a9b181fc252108de45720d4645ac245e1ba463", "a487431ec4e08c336281a126b4e6f0b10c48d70d", "fa6e4f0c1f2bf434be91c17c6dd4d9a535d78fdd", "15f10002718c16c40c1296f53f25934f1676c80a", "d252e3f7f118ff97b3e752126f59d12cf5fb7b4b", "2ca3599de8f6deffd331368d38ff87a9d206f634", "951865c6d89e9e7822700dad42caf8bd29896d48", "26a373beb4c7d50143bb0f262eeef0b1432c7659", "58f72b53d576c6e4a42b4d8812e5542ffa2c03cc"], "year": 2011, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8e585e115a6ac65365b4bc9dbab3d2c8b5639be5", "sources": [], "pdfUrls": ["http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/_file_directory_/papers/582.pdf", "http://publications.csee.umbc.edu/publications/552/resources/582", "https://publications.csee.umbc.edu/publications/552/resources/582"], "venue": "AAAI 2011", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "81891695", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

In this paper, based on the analysis of some typical cluster-based routing algorithms, a novel cluster-based energy efficient routing algorithm is proposed to solve the hot spot problem involved in inter-cluster routing and optimize network lifetime. Clusters are formed by local competition and the role of cluster head is rotated among sensor nodes periodically to balance energy consumption in WSN. Furthermore, Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is utilized to search optimal inter-cluster routing path for the optimization of network lifetime. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of the routing algorithm proposed in this paper.", "authors": [{"name": "Yi-Ping  Chen", "ids": ["47557635"]}, {"name": "Yu-Zhong  Chen", "ids": ["3245561"]}], "inCitations": ["8865c0a4c41a6a72f3f62c345fa711995a5742d8", "ae301ed6d13d4d693ceae607c86b1e6713360c81", "cedba86929a8bfec88518c45c4d56dd0a892eb31", "18ce1a63dd6b2d5b146eb1d0934239beea3528bd", "bfc5f930a78caf32767bbe13808334d63a2e15d5", "82ab9816a707d7df204ea3262c4b2fce8323fbfd", "64c66b973eb4d97f73fa4354bc426ad001dcada3", "39a0bbe4d8ed095f22f382343251988d6ef1fbdd", "8c5133ebc90c5c082f3a72228f75220843e8f2e8", "aa1e0a44329bdce2cc78d5b42a39ec5792611c0b"], "outCitations": ["b3834aed2c564d2dbeacf8c1b733dbe5c9c07fbf", "976ead4d9334c0e4275f707e81f4502cac91a5cf", "cf183fb176e8bf3a3f8645c17732b4b11851fd05", "ee1598607f1cbb6288c46f9d9c96414e4c4a7083", "f0ef8d0946614c050352593deae0041704a0b64b", "41c1486ca462148021828ea9dfcb861fa249e8fd", "e85bc7183958b3627f06276dd21f066ae6325669", "2bf08043a2bf4657e36fb2e2123363f14ef9aefb"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3cbf3f752acda04c5cfeba5eb2ca91ca5351fee1", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580625"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "2", "journalPages": "1031-1036", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580625", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580625", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1977233499", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

The projection of this collapsed state on the socio-economic basis results in interference between the developed idea and the perceptions of the supporting community, undergoing an eventual collapse for an entrepreneurial decision that reflects the shared vision of its stakeholders.

The deployment of RFID readers is essential to the success of RFID applications. RFID is a wireless communication technology and therefore the interaction between the RFID tag and reader is easily influenced by many factors. Current RFID reader deployment based on designer experience or predefined mathematical model without field test. When the RFID system is fielded, the performance may be unsatisfactory. Therefore, we propose a neural network based method to select the best location of RFID reader deployment among possible choices in the field. The major factor affecting the performance of neural network is the architecture selection which we will select via a minimization of its localized generalization error to enhance the neural network's generalization capability. Radial basis function neural network is adapted owing to its fast learning speed. The neural network will suggest the best location iteratively to reduce the number of cost and labor intensive random trials.

Work on intentions in multi-agent systems has focused on joint intention models, which characterise the mental state of agents with a shared goal engaged in teamwork. In the absence of shared goals, however, intentions play another crucial role in multi-agent activity: they provide a basis around which agents can mutually coordinate activities. Models based on shared goals do not attempt to account for or explain this role of intentions. In this paper, we present a formal model of multi-agent systems in which belief-desire-intention agents choose their intentions taking into account the intentions of others. To understand rational mental states in such a setting, we formally define and investigate notions of multi-agent intention equilibrium, which are related to equilibrium concepts in game theory.", "authors": [{"name": "John  Grant", "ids": ["145899413"]}, {"name": "Sarit  Kraus", "ids": ["144992450"]}, {"name": "Michael  Wooldridge", "ids": ["48106342"]}], "inCitations": ["2d1565d0837a49c2103d7fd01bfa3498c2966fe6", "be6c1713c13214f92da4d4d198c292574cd5f705", "13b17b7b42c76c56b2e47bf8334ff585353cafd4", "7a281e50e34151841e0e5f97b67ece43971fba36", "b67cef3abd71f0909ae25a445b749727d41489af", "358b7787b6f3008c2b3052b694b02e30becb96d1", "75bef7a3d795ebd457ed7e2b243643ecacc828fd", "34ca68bfd8c316ae7114517effd5e5fcdd3ec72f", "5847b8b8ec710b314ff96cefb4795ebe4eec7b0c", "b897f8b2307919874aa9a550ef3a6be84149ce0a"], "outCitations": ["e043e02a71e85f5ccbe64620d82bb82556954e86", "a4be2d27bacc76fc081042edaaf409122107d7fe", "fb4594726425a5da1647897fac412b6e9ebcd5b8", "5502b8646f35d355ec80056a93218cc7a59ba4d5", "082245d5b2c4276267fe6eecd8bb496d5e196168", "c20b273f30d0b2fe5000739a386ba58b0e922bf6", "3f771e542d3d8546d55c13b0074dd4bdf48e6813", "366e2672602dfc197e0e069a66c0e942e3937657", "ef336fe9c04559654936413f4910a54b7ae5028c", "15eed5d19fd6d23cd0fe877255ee97b0d2f6405a", "4c3dbac2ad027a3514b0856f42e8efebbc57bee1", "937c576f7b39a53908d8c646983ddd2bda94a321", "c7759f2a34f205bd846ff3ba4989647ff8fe02b9", "6a222f2787607ecdb75b08e5f495fbed3c15d418", "75337e504d905b99c0d6464e0c43cd1eff6ad9f4", "db097eac96dd0ce5b7874f9ae74306fac5b0b2df"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1d9ee2aaa319ec6e2e637f5933ccb224264ce353", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/download/1830/2090", "http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~sarit/data/articles//AAAI2010-MWooldridge.pdf", "http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sarit_Kraus2/publication/221602963_Intentions_in_Equilibrium/links/09e41511aab584ed47000000.pdf", "http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~sarit/data/articles/AAAI2010-MWooldridge.pdf", "http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/users/sarit/data/articles/AAAI2010-MWooldridge.pdf", "http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~sarit/data/articles/AAAI2010-MWooldridge.pdf", "http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.wooldridge/pubs/aaai2010.pdf", "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI10/paper/view/1830", "http://www.cs.biu.ac.il/~sarit/data/articles/AAAI2010-MWooldridge.pdf"], "venue": "AAAI", "journalName": "", "journalVolume": "", "journalPages": "786-791", "doi": "", "doiUrl": "", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "1582989478", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 1}

We find that for low levels of pollution, pressure exerted by society can indeed encourage the development and use of non-polluting technology, with greater pressure being associated with faster achievement of efficiency parity and lower overall pollution. However, greater pressure is also associated with lower populations and at the highest levels of pressure there are significant risks of population crashes. We find that these results hold for both localized pollution and globalized pollution, with globalized pollution encouraging faster achievement of efficiency parity. For high levels of pollution we find that introducing societal pressure significantly increases the occurrence of population crashes, and thus the strategy is only effective under certain conditions.", "authors": [{"name": "Daniel E.

We present a multi-region tracking algorithm to follow lung tumors on CT projections and intreatment portal image movies before and during external beam radiotherapy, respectively. Finding suitable landmarks for tracking is challenging due to low contrast in the images. We begin by defining a large set of landmark candidates and a sequence of training images representing the range of tumor motion. Each landmark is found automatically by seeking regions of maximum variance in the image gray values. Small, square templates are centered around each landmark to be used for tracking in sequential MV images. An iterative learning algorithm is employed to select the most suitable templates among the large collection of candidates for the training data set. This subset of templates is then applied to a similar data set for testing. The results of the automatic multi-template selection and tracking compare well to those of manually selected single template tracking.

The huge size of a continuously flowing data has put forward a number of challenges in data stream analysis. Exploration of the structure of streamed data represented a major challenge that resulted in introducing various clustering algorithms. However, current clustering algorithms still lack the ability to efficiently discover clusters of arbitrary densities in data streams. In this paper, a new grid-based and density-based algorithm is proposed for clustering streaming data. It addresses drawbacks of recent algorithms in discovering clusters of arbitrary densities. The algorithm uses an online component to map the input data to grid cells. An offline component is then used to cluster the grid cells based on density information. Relative density relatedness measures and a dynamic range neighborhood are proposed to differentiate clusters of arbitrary densities. The experimental evaluation shows considerable improvements upon the state-of-the-art algorithms in both clustering quality and scalability.

Though comprehensive comparisons, either learning algorithms or feature selection strategies, have been fully made in the text categorization field, few work was done for a LSHTC task due to high computational cost and complicated structural label characteristics. For the first time, this paper compares two popular learning frameworks, namely hierarchical support vector machine (SVM) and k nearest neighbor (k-NN) that are applied to a LSHTC task. Experiment results show that the latter outperforms the former in this LSHTC task, which is quite different from the usual results for normal text categorization tasks. Then this paper does a comparative study on different similarity measures and ranking approaches in k-NN framework for LSHTC task. Conclusions can be drawn that k-NN is more appropriate for the LSHTC task than hierarchical SVM and for a specific LSHTC task. BM25 outperforms other similarity measures and List Weak gains a better performance than other ranking approaches. We also find an interesting phenomenon that using all the labels of the retrieved neighbors can remarkably improve classification performance over only using the first label of the retrieved neighbors.", "authors": [{"name": "Jian  Zhang", "ids": ["1679327"]}, {"name": "Hai  Zhao", "ids": ["47941144"]}, {"name": "Bao-Liang  Lu", "ids": ["1715839"]}], "inCitations": ["c94db6449e508c5c95157c01b91ac8c59907198c", "8bd313a62cfb6f59b3b45ef4c22b6e001c6b98c6"], "outCitations": ["6c0e5b9602d0560b525cbd2a03cdbc8f6b3f163e", "8e53518083c4dfbdba8cf2ab55c2f6b18c70fef5", "0efb841403aa6252b39ae6975c1cc5410554ef7b", "6b20af22b0734757d9ead382b201a65f9dd637cc", "8e948e69da982310a283d04ba185ff2bdcf43a2a", "40212e9474c3ddf3d8c6ffd13dd3211ec9406c49", "e2c56c2e8a22b5606a24edcd96d8212938608dc5", "5a2012a6805f8ccf7225a7d192bda4a3863a5236"], "year": 2010, "s2Url": "https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7a792ffa437601252f9a7dc3960c25d6a6ecea0a", "sources": ["DBLP"], "pdfUrls": ["http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~blu/papers/2010/ICMLC2010.pdf", "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580696", "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bao-Liang_Lu2/publication/224176111_A_comparative_study_on_two_large-scale_hierarchical_text_classification_tasks'_solutions/links/00b4952a20ab7d3a3b000000.pdf"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalName": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics", "journalVolume": "6", "journalPages": "3275-3280", "doi": "10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580696", "doiUrl": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580696", "pmid": "", "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science"], "magId": "2129214336", "s2PdfUrl": "", "entities": [], "label": 2}

But, such limited-memory cost-bounded search algorithms can bear a huge overhead relative to BFBB due to re-expanding nodes with cost less than C* (essential nodes), equal to C* (boundary nodes) and/or exceeding C* (non-essential nodes) where C* denotes the cost of an optimal solution. Our contributions in this paper are two fold. First, we propose a novel available-memory non-minimal cost-bounded search method (AM-NCBS KBEST) that tries to minimize the search overhead on a single problem instance by striking a trade-off between essential node re-expansion and non-essential node expansion depending upon the value of a cost bound choice parameter \u2019 K\u2019. We show that this new strategy reduces the search overhead of the previous best available-memory costbounded search strategy by at least half even for the most conservative values of \u2019 K\u2019. Next, we present a learning-based approach (AM-NCBS KLEARN) to intelligently predict nonminimal cost-bounds for solving a new problem instance by analyzing various cost bound choices that when used over the course of the search, on a number of previously solved instances, result in the least cumulative overhead on an average. We demonstrate on a set of 100 problem instances that the learning based approach further reduces AM-NCBS KBEST\u2019s overhead that may ensue due to bad choices of 'K'.", "authors": [{"name": "Sandeep K.
